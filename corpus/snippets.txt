In the late s Bond Stores the largest mens clothing chain at the time created a sensation in New York City by offering a wide selection of suits with two pairs of pants instead of one reintroducing a level of product choice not seen since before the war When the line of hopeful buyers at its Times Square store stretched around the block Bond had to impose a limit of two suits per customer During World War II the apparel and textile industries had been converted to supply field jackets overcoats and uniforms to the US and Allied Forces But in the years immediately following the war returning soldiers the end of rationing and pentup customer demand meant apparel was in short supplyFifty years later it is hard to imagine a retailerbe it a highend department store mass merchandiser or catalog servicelimiting an individual customers clothing purchase Retailers collect detailed pointofsales information that reflects the realtime demand for goods by consumers Through new computer systems they share this information with suppliers who in turn can ship orders within days to automated distribution centers The contemporary equivalent of Bond Stores now has a much better chance of avoiding stockouts of popular items and the inventory gluts that lead to costly markdowns By the same token the overall risk associated with fickle consumers numerous selling seasons and segmented marketsalong with fierce overseas competitionhas currently made this a tough arena for American retailers and manufacturersThe most surprising aspect of this story is that todays US apparel and textile industriesleft for dead by business commentators and economic analysts in the shave begun to transform themselves reaping new competitive advantages Although Bond Stores customers were thrilled by a suit with two pairs of pants contemporary customers want and expect a huge range of choices and the consumer desire for limitless variety has kept the American apparel industry alive In for instance American consumers purchased outerwear garments all coats jackets shirts dresses blouses sweaters trousers slacks and shorts per capita in China the estimated number of such garments was only per capitaThe transformation of US clothing and textile manufacturing is very much still in progress and has by no means been successful for every company but these industries have entered a renaissance of sorts one that reflects new information technologies and management practices as well as the new economics of international trade This book describes what has happened since the postwar era in three related industriesretail apparel and textilesand what such companies must do to improve performance We cover the histories of these industries including the information technologies that have transformed these enterprises manufacturing processes inventory management the new role of logistics and global trade implications and policiesThe story is a complex one involving many individual cases and specifics This study began with a focus on apparel manufacturing but we soon concluded that apparel production must be viewed as an integral part of a channel A channel is the set of all firms and relationships that get a product to market including the original acquisition of raw materials production of the item at a manufacturing facility distribution to a retailer sale of the finished item to the customer and any installation repair or service activities that follow the saleA retailappareltextile channel typically includes the companies that manufacture synthetic fibers produce gather and refine natural fibers spin fiber into yarn weave or knit yarn into fabric manufacture buttons zippers and other garment components and cut and sew fabric into garments It also includes the retailers who sell garments to end consumers The retail link often involves services or instructions to suppliers about fabric and garment design packaging distribution order fulfillment and transportation And it is in some of these areas particularly distribution and order fulfillment that channel dynamics have undergone substantial change during the last decadeSupply channels are not new of course for centuries fabricmakers have sold their wares to those who cut and sew garments But until recently most channels in the textile and apparel industries have been characterized by armslength relationships among relatively autonomous firms It is only since the mids that a number of market and technological changes have encouraged companies to enhance the links among different stages of production and distribution Indeed retailers like WalMart Stores Kmart Corporation and Dillards Inc have been the driving forces behind changes in manufacturing and logistics systems in a way that was unheard of in Bond Stores time For instance entrepreneur Sam Walton built a retail juggernaut that began with thirtynine WalMart stores in and grew to almost three thousand by He did so by insisting that suppliers implement information technologies for exchanging sales data adopt standards for product labeling and use modern methods of material handling that assured customers a variety of products at low pricesWe contend that this revolution in retailing practices will determine future competitive outcomes in retailappareltextile channels These new practiceswhich we call lean retailinghave compelled apparel producers to reorganize the manner in which they relate to retail customers undertake distribution forecast and plan production and manage their supplier relations Lean retailing has also changed the way the textile industry relates to both apparel producers and retailers Most important because the apparel industry has been one of the first to face the full brunt of the retail revolution its story illuminates pervasive changes under way in the entire economyIn many respects our findings defy the conventional wisdom When we began our research we were advised by American industry participants to establish better performance measuresfor example how many minutes does it take to make a shirt The traditional view holds that because manufacturing performance is determined by the labor time required to produce an item then what applies to cars for example can also apply to clothing therefore US apparel manufacturers might be able to save themselves by improving assembly operations Yet after years of studying hundreds of American apparel firms we have found that direct labor content is not the primary issue The companies that have adopted new information systems and management practices participating in a wellintegrated channel are the ones with the strongest performance todaynot those that have simply improved assembly operationsThe changes we examine in retailing are not only profound but rippling through a growing segment of the American economy They have already transformed channel relations in such industries as food and grocery homebuilding products personal computers and office products The retail revolution is affecting the automobile health care and pharmaceutical industries as well Now that manufacturers of power tools and ball bearings talk about their products as fashion items the apparel industryalways subject to the whims of fashionhas much to say to any industry that involves retailing Every channel has its particular history elements and dynamics and retailappareltextile channels are no exception A Stitch in Time uses the US apparel story to highlight the transformation of retailing and manufacturing across the boardFive Decades of ChangeWhen Bond Stores had customers lining up around the block to buy suits casual wear as we know it today did not exist Even in the s men wore suits ties and hats to the ballpark and women were clothed in dresses and millinery As recently as the dress code at Harvard required undergraduate men to wear a collar necktie and jacket in the dining halls women had to wear a dress or a skirt and blouse It wasnt until the s that these vestiges of formality gave way to blue jeans and Tshirtsthe casual wear uniform The s ushered in yuppie brands and in the s history repeated itself as baby boomers children adopted the bedraggled grunge look Many business firms have casual days for office attire Now six out of ten US employers now have casual days in their workplaces all but a few establishing this practice during the s About seven out of ten organizations with dressdown days permit employees to wear polo shirts jeans and sneakersThe US apparel and textile industries like the clothing and other products they produce have undergone tremendous changes over the past half century From to domestic production of apparel doubled while textile production less vulnerable to imports increased almost three times Yet since World War II shifting tastes in clothes rising real incomes and domestic and foreign competition within the textile and apparel industries have markedly reduced the proportion of consumer budgets expended on apparel and its upkeep laundry and dry cleaning In December apparels share of the Consumer Price Index was percent by December that percentage had fallen to percent of average household expendituresMeanwhile structural changes in the retail industry have influenced how and where clothing is sold The growth of the highway system around central cities and the rapid expansion of suburbs created new opportunities for shopping centers malls and other outlets closer to a growing number of two wageearner families The metropolitan suburbs increased housing units in the s through the s far faster than the inner cities or the rural suburbs Because inner cities retained a high proportion of lower income families increased purchasing power for shelter food and clothing shifted to the suburbs That means the large department stores traditionally based in cities such as Macys or Marshall Field and Companyserved by mass transportation and marketed through newspaper advertisementssuffered from the competition of mass distributors like WalMart and specialty shops in new locationsThe enterprises that compose the apparel and textile industries manufacture a wide variety of products and the mix has also changed since the postwar era Over the past thirtyfive years in the textile industry the number of workers employed for carpet and rug production has doubled and is projected to expand further over the next decade In the apparel industry more than a quarter of all workers now produce nonclothing items like curtains draperies house furnishings and automotive trimmings once again employment since the s in these areas has doubled while it has dropped off dramatically for actual garmentmakingThese changes are related to new technology and foreign competition Exhortations to buy the union label or Made in the USA have done relatively little to stem the tide of clothing assembled overseas For example the per capita number of outerwear garments purchased in the United States increased from to in the period from to Imports however provided half the total in leaving domestic production with only about the same per capita number of outerwear garments as three decades earlierall this even though apparel and textiles in the United States have long been characterized by special import regulation Tariffs on their imports have remained higher than many other manufactured goods Since the s national policymakers have sought to moderate the growth of imports primarily through agreements with other governments The MultiFiber Arrangement MFA a network of bilateral agreements negotiated with participating nations which became effective in established quotas for imports largely related to estimates of the growth of the US domestic market The stated purpose of the MFA was to provide for the orderly growth of trade in these products among countries on a negotiated basis Advocates emphasized that textiles and apparel offer proportionately more jobs including entrylevel positions to less well educated more disadvantaged groups in the United States than most other sectors of the economyYet with the signing of the agreements that grew out of the Uruguay Round of international trade negotiations that concluded in the MFA has now been replaced textiles and apparel trade are to be integrated into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade GATT over a tenyear period that ends January Many American industry participants and policymakers believe these changes could deal a fatal blow to the US apparel industry which will become even more exposed to global competition The impact of these trade changes remains uncertain and national policies that take them into account are still evolving But if one did not consider the shift in retailing practices that is also recasting the apparel industryand turned some American companies into unexpected leadersit might indeed look like Made in the USA was a lost causeA Dying Industryor NotFor many commentators a book about the future of the US apparel and textile industries is still an oxymoron The conventional wisdom paints a grim picture of where these industries are headed Lowcost labor overseas and the increasing penetration of imports have certainly undercut American apparel manufacturers apparel imports grew rapidly in most categories starting in the mids If we measure import penetration in physical units rather than dollar value import penetration for mens and boys suits for example went from just percent in to percent by A similar expansion in imports occurred for mens and boys trousers womens and girls dresses and womens slacks and shortsAs one consequence the number of business failures among US apparel manufacturers climbed from in to a high of in Not surprisingly employment in the apparel sector during this period declined appreciably And the US Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a further reduction in the domestic apparel industry during the period to from workers to just this from an industry that employed about million employees in and reached a peak of million employees in The conventional wisdom explains the industrys decline in this way Apparel particularly womens apparel is driven by pricebased competition among generally small manufacturing and contracting establishments Labor costs represent a significant portion of cost for many garment categories and US wage levels far exceed those of competitors in countries like the Peoples Republic of China and Mexico Although the magnitude of these differences varies as exchange rates fluctuate under any realistic exchangerate scenario the labor cost differential is sufficiently high to put US manufacturers at a very significant competitive disadvantageThe manufacture of mens shirts provides another illustration Throughout much of the postWorld War II era the majority of mens shirts sold in the United States were white dress shirts primarily through department stores Shirts with stripes patterns and uncommon colors constituted less than percent of all dress shirts sold through the s In this environment low fashion content and limited product variety made demand for individual shirts relatively predictable Store buyers succeeded by striking deals with apparel manufacturers for large shipments of white shirts at the lowest possible price and with long delivery lead times Unlike the womens industry where style has always mattered more relatively large mens apparel manufacturers such as Haggar Hart Schaffner and Marx Fruit of the Loom Arrow Shirt Company and Hathaway Shirt emerged seeking to capture economies of scaleBut hourly compensation levels have increasingly hurt US apparelmakers if performance is principally determined on a pricecost basis For example because of wage differentials between the countries US apparelmakers would need to be times more productive than firms in Hong Kong to be competitive As a result US shirt manufacturers lost enormous market share to offshore producers And employment in mens and boys shirts between and declined an average of percent a yearThere is just one problem with these accounts Although the production of basic white dress shirts may lend itself to a pricecost analysis this staple good like many staple goods now constitutes only a small proportion of all shirt production by little more than percent of mens dress shirts were white This onetime staple has been replaced by shirts of dizzying diversity in fabric design and style providing the final consumer with a huge assortment of shirts while exposing retailers and manufacturers to increased risk of holding large volumes of unsold goods Classical economic assumptions about market competition are not directly applicable in this situation even in a mature industry like apparelAs shown in later chapters manufacturers that invest in advanced information technologies and use them to change their methods of planning and production can significantly reduce the amount of inventory they hold thereby reducing the need to mark down or write off unsold products at the end of a season These manufacturers also earn twice as much in profits than suppliers that continue to operate along traditional lines Yet the distinguishing feature of such high performers is not their success in shaving off labor costs in the assembly room it is their effort in changing basic aspects of the way they manage their enterprisesAlthough it is true that the American apparel industry could have given up in the early s with only distribution centers and designers remaining in this country it did not Instead manufacturers have developed or have been compelled to develop a competitive service for retailers best practice American producers can now deliver orders with just a few days notice something overseas suppliers have difficulty achieving These US firms do so through electronic data interchange EDI automated distribution centers and sophisticated inventory managementa triumph of information technology speed and flexibility over low labor ratesThe Channel Perspective Five PropositionsSo what has changed the prognosis for American apparel and textiles and provided new opportunities for these industries The answer is not to be found simply in the clout of a few retailers or the use of bar codes or EDI To understand why the apparel industry is a prototype for others we need to look at the underlying dynamics of demand and its impact on manufacturing practice Consider once again the contemporary customers appetite for variety Increased rates of product introduction product proliferation and shortened product cycles mean that companies have to respond much faster to rapidly changing marketsFor our purposes we can represent growing product diversity in the form of a fashion triangle Figure Apparel items at the very top of this triangle include dresses from Paris Milan and New York runways which represent a very small share of apparel sold The majority of fashion products also have a short selling lifeusually one seasonbut are produced for a broader market At the triangles bottom are basic products that remain in a retailers or manufacturers collection for several years such as mens white dress shirts or underwear Basics historically constituted the majority of apparel products sold In the middle of the triangle are fashionbasic products typically variants on a basic item but containing some fashion element such as stonewashed jeans or khaki pants with pleats or trim This expanding center of the fashion triangle indicates where the industry is headed Because a growing percentage of basic apparel items have some fashion content fashionbasic products are driving product proliferationProduct proliferation and shorter product cycles reflected in everchanging styles and product differentiation contribute to general demand uncertainty for both retailers and manufacturers thereby making demand forecasting and production planning harder every day In a world where manufacturers must supply an increasing number of products with fashion elements speed and flexibility are crucial capabilities for firms wrestling with product proliferation whether they are retailers trying to offer a wide range of choices to consumers or manufacturers responding to retail demands for shipmentsTo be sure technological advances in communication and transportation have helped supply channels operate more effectively and efficiently in providing diverse goods Although these changes have provided strong motivation for increased channel coordination the development and implementation of key facilitating technologieslike bar codes the later spread of EDI and automated distribution centershave been the real movers here New channel relationships in turn have led to better performance based on a variety of standards and enhanced the competitiveness of many sectors of these US industriesNote that these significant technological market and environmental changes largely originated outside the apparel industry itself As we will make clear changes that emerge in a market economy in one sphere often have unforeseen consequences in others Bar codes for instance began with the food and grocery industry in the s to lower the labor costs of cashier work and avoid delays to customers With the commercialization of the laser automated checkout became more than an industry vision A committee of CEOs from grocery manufacturers food chain stores and other companies met in to develop a universal product code for scanning purposes the first five digits stand for the manufacturer and the last five identify the item at the stockkeeping unit SKU level All the digits are represented in the nowfamiliar sequence of light and dark bars of differing widths By bar codes had begun to spread throughout food chain stores and grocery manufacturers But almost another decade passed before the practice was adopted by apparel retailers and manufacturersIn later chapters about the retail revolution inventory management and apparel operations we provide an indepth look at how such new technologies have affected the related industries For now we present five propositions that arise from the channel perspective of this book The conventional wisdom can no longer predict future industry dynamics or offer guideposts for private and public policies The channel perspective however indicates why the demand uncertainty and risk associated with todays apparel industry offer new opportunities for US firmsProposition The retail apparel and textile sectors are increasingly linked as a channel through information and distribution relationshipsIn conventional terms these three sectors are considered distinct industries separated by traditional market relationships For example armslength transactions between retail buyers and apparel sellers determine prices and quantities of goods to be delivered Apparel companies periodically made deliveries based on these contracts and the transaction was then completed In such a world coordination problems between the parties were of little concernBut as we have already emphasized this is not the real world of apparel today At its most fundamental level the channel perspective reflects a revolution in retail practices These practices have resulted in the integration of enterprises at all stages of the distribution and production chain because of the infusion of realtime information on consumer sales Instead of gearing planning and production decisions to forecasts and guesses made months in advance of a selling season firms now receive periodic ongoing orders based on actual consumer expenditures And companies in transformed retailappareltextile channels have established a complex web of computer hardware and software other technologies and managerial practices that have blurred the traditional boundaries between retailers and suppliersProposition For apparel manufacturers the key to success is no longer solely price competition but the ability to introduce sophisticated information links forecasting capabilities and management systemsThe conventional wisdom holds that the basis of competitive performance for apparel manufacturers is lowest priceperiod According to Martin Feldstein then chairman of President Reagans Council of Economic AdvisersThe labor intensive US apparel market cannot and should not compete with much lower cost labor elsewhere The stuff depends on somebody sitting at a sewing machine and stitching sleeves on it is crazy to hurt American consumers by forcing them to buy that at or an hour of labor We ought to be out of that businessFortunately clothing production today is more than a simple pricecost game Successful apparel manufacturers must now focus on their capability to respond accurately and efficiently to the stringent demands placed on them by new retailing practices This requires establishing systems to handle electronic realtime orders as well as creating management and information systems capable of using incoming information to forecast plan track production and manufacture or source products in a flexible and efficient manner Needless to say these new skills were not part of the management arsenal of traditional apparel firmsYet our research indicates that apparel leaders are building these new skills Analysis of detailed industry data demonstrates that there have been substantial increases in apparel suppliers investments in information technologies distribution systems and other associated services during the same period that new types of retailing practices emerged In addition we have found that those firms under greatest pressure by innovative retailers have been the most likely to make such investments as well as to invest in innovations in other stages of manufacturing Most important apparelmakers that have invested in major innovations to collect and use information perform much better than those that have done little to innovate production beyond providing basic information links to retailersProposition The assembly roomthe traditional focus of attention for industry competitivenesscan provide competitive benefits only if other more fundamental changes in manufacturing practice have been introducedThe inputs to garment production are relatively straightforward fabric thread accessories like buttons and zippers labor and a modest level of capital investment The majority of input costs are composed of materials and labor For example close to percent of the value of shipments for mens shirts comes from the cost of materials while percent arises from compensation costs Reducing textile costs is a viable option for larger apparel manufacturers they can exert some pressure on suppliers because of the size of their orders Small manufacturers however have few such options As a result the conventional method of unit cost reduction revolves once again around reducing labor costs Because the largest labor cost is concentrated in assembly phases the focus of most productivity efforts has been in the sewing roomGarment assembly is typically done by bundle production which entails breaking garmentmaking into a series of worksteps or operations Each operation is assigned to a single worker who receives a bundle of unfinished garment parts and undertakes her single operation on each item in the bundle Completed bundles are then moved forward to the next operator in the production process To foster productivity physical output per worker and constrain supervisory costs wages are paid on a piecerate basis providing incentives for rapid completion of the operationMany industry participants have sought to improve assembly productivity the holy grail for US manufacturers This generally involves modifications to improve the efficiency of the bundle system using a variety of methods engineering the assembly process to reduce direct labor requirements for each step changing the incentive rate to encourage workers to increase their pace or adopting new technologies to substitute for laborintensive assembly steps It is true that through ongoing refinement of apparel assembly processes American manufacturers have been able to achieve some continuous improvements in labor productivity The International Trade Administration of the US Department of Commerce expressed this view in thatThe producer who hesitates to employ new strategies will not likely survive as expected innovations in technology dramatically alter the nature of clothing manufacture Garmentmaking in its current laborintensive form will eventually be phased out in favor of automated robotized manufacturing geared for almost instantaneous transition from one style to another The difficulty of handling cut fabrics by machines may be resolved in the near future and the quest for higher operating speeds will then receive more attention taking production levels to new heightsYet here the conventional wisdom misses other significant measures of performance Managers in wellintegrated channels pay attention to inventory costs inventory replenishment practices information reliability and time to market rather than the traditional direct costs of labor and materials alone In fact competitive performance is already being driven less by how a company manages its assembly operations and more by how it manages the logistics of its operations as a whole Our study shows that an apparel manufacturer can still be successful with a traditionally organized sewing room a firm with innovative and productive assembly operations on the other hand may not be competitively viable if it has not invested in information links with retailers and other changes in management practicesApparel manufacturers are not the only ones learning this lesson the hard way The emphasis on labor productivity that has preoccupied practitioners and analysts in many industriessuch as the total labor minutes required to assemble a carno longer makes as much sense now that information technology has revolutionized retailing in many product segments For instance the current labor costs associated with assembly constitute percent of the final cost of a car In contrast distributionrelated coststhose associated with the traditional structure of automobile retailingconstitute anywhere between and percent of final cost It is little wonder that car companies are currently in the throes of radically restructuring their method of automobile distributionProposition Instead of fashion as the saving grace of the channel basic and fashionbasic products will prove critical to its longterm survivalWhen people consider the US apparel industry they often think of New York Citys Seventh Avenue which is driven by new design constantly changing seasonal offerings and a willingness by consumers to pay a premium for the cutting edge of fashion New York City and Los Angeles continue to have a competitive advantage in this area because a large number of designers and manufacturers are located in these cities and can respond quickly to changing demands as well as shape them This infrastructure allows for quick response on the fashion end of the womens and to a more limited extent mens markets Once established a variety of proponents believe the experience at the fashion end can be diffused downward to less fashionoriented products As a result some of the fashionoriented products that had been sourced offshore can then return to the United StatesThose with a pessimistic view of domestic apparel manufacturing often assume that the high fashion end of the industry the top of the fashion triangle in Figure page may be its best hope because US firms can capitalize on their proximity to market The highly acclaimed report by the MIT Commission on Industrial Productivity Made in America concludesApparel textile and fiber firms and retailers have recently joined to launch the Quick Response Program designed to improve information flow standardize recording systems and improve turnaround time throughout the system The program could be an important boon to productivity and competitiveness Will Quick Response succeed According to industry experts that depends on whether it diffuses down to the highfashion quick turnaround segments of the industry or like much new technology in this industry is adapted to suit the needs of firms still committed to mass productionRegardless of where Quick Response has succeeded however our research indicates that very different timebased competitive demands have emerged in the industry driven not by voluntary acceptance of policies but by the changing nature of market competition among retailers Rather than arising in the fashion Seventh Avenue segment of the industry the new form of retail competition involves basic and fashionbasic products like jeans intimate apparel and Tshirtsthe bottom of the fashion triangleBasic and fashionbasic apparel categories now constitute the lions share of industry sales accounting for approximately percent of all shipments This implies that a far larger portion of the industry may be viable in the long run than the part that could be saved by quick response at the fashion end Bear in mind however that this viability depends on manufacturers using information to plan and execute production in a more sophisticated manner than usual for this and other industriesSimilar dynamics are cropping up in nonclothing areas as well Grocery stores now stock a profusion of toothbrushes Home Depot has shelves and shelves of different light bulbs and Dell offers customconfigured personal computers The growing presence of fashionbasic elements in myriad consumer products means that all retailers and suppliers may find new competitive opportunities using replenishmentProposition Even with full implementation of GATT a viable apparel industry can remain in North America drawing on a range of production processes in the United States Canada Mexico the Caribbean and Latin AmericaWhen it comes to international trade agreements the conventional wisdom sounds most bleak It leads to stark conclusions about the longterm viability of the US apparel industry even with steps taken to improve assemblyroom productivity and fashionoriented quick response The following comment is typicalAmong the factors that are expected to have a substantial impact on employment in the textiles and apparel industries perhaps the most influential will be the trade policy agreed to in the GATT The apparel industry which is far more labor intensive and less competitive internationally than the textile industry will probably sustain most of the losses from the new trade environmentEven here the channel perspective tells a somewhat different story When domestic channels reduce lead times to market particularly with basic and fashionbasic products the comparative advantage of imports declinesdespite the lower wage costs of foreign competitors elimination of quotas on imports and tariff reductions This means that the US apparel industry is not necessarily doomed by high direct labor costs at least for certain products In fact we expect a resurgence in certain sectors because of the innovative practices being pursued by some manufacturers and their retailersTo be sure the international sourcing arrangements that have been created by retailers and manufacturers over the last twenty years reflect a quest for minimizing unit labor costs But the long lead times they require will increasingly challenge such arrangements Manufacturers and retailers that rely on international sourcing will therefore have to reassess the total costs associated with offshore production and revise existing arrangementsTrade data already suggest a major restructuring in the sources of US apparel imports The surge in apparel imports in the s came from lowwage countries primarily the Asian Big Fourthe Peoples Republic of China Hong Kong Taiwan and Korea This group of nations provided percent of all apparel imports in and percent of all apparel imports by measured in squaremeter equivalents a measure of quantity But by the Big Fours share of imports had fallen to percent Their US share has been increasingly displaced by those of Mexico and Caribbean nations Although these shifts in part reflect changes in US trade policy such as the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA they fundamentally arise from new sourcing patterns attributable to channel integration and the consequent need for apparel items that can be delivered in a shorter time to the US marketThe implications of these changes from a private and public policy perspective are enormous Competing in the transformed retailappareltextile channel now requires a set of management practices for both domestic and international sourcing A successful US apparelmaker for instance may assemble basic mens khaki pants in average sizes in Mexico taking advantage of low labor costs as well as Mexicos proximity to the makers Texas distribution centers at the same time this company can choose to manufacture products with more variable demand like khaki pants with narrow waists and long inseams in the United States providing fast turnaround for retailers and lower exposure to inventory riskGoing to India or China for low prices alone is no longer the smartest course of action for American manufacturers Increasingly they will factor in demand uncertainty and product proliferation when making such sourcing decisions As we will discuss throughout many of the capabilities required for this model of competition are new to the apparel industry The postGATT competitive arena will be extremely demanding but based on the innovations many US manufacturers are making we believe the American apparel industry has a futureHow This Book Is OrganizedBecause of our separate academic perspectives and disciplines the research underlying A Stitch in Time comes from a variety of sources Much of our analysis is based on detailed survey data we collected from business unitsa sample representing about onethird of the shipmentsin the apparel industry We supplemented the original survey with microdata collected from a variety of US government and private sources Our work also draws on numerous case studies of individual enterprises and data gathered at site visits We have modeled specific channel dynamics in order to understand what optimal practices might look like as the channel develops over time Finally we have worked closely with business executives government officials labor leaders and our academic colleagues to exchange views test ideas and refine our results on a continuing basis The appendices present a list of acronyms a description of the HCTAR survey and other data sources and a list of companies that we visited or at which we conducted interviews with their executivesA Stitch in Time is organized into five sections roughly corresponding to the channel components The first two chapters provide an overview and historical context Chapters through analyze developments in the retail sector Chapters and establish a bridge between retailing and appareltextile operations through an exploration of the problems of inventory managementa central aspect of emerging channel dynamics Chapters through focus on the apparel industry Chapters and look at textiles Chapters through examine the channel as a whole from global privateperformance and publicpolicy perspectivesAfter this introduction Chapter The Past as Prologue offers a brief history of recent technological and human resource developments in retailing apparel productionincluding the role of jobbers contractors and manufacturersand textile enterprises Here we make clear that the changes wrought by lean retailing echo the last industrial transformation which occurred in the late nineteenth century with the advent of the railroad and telegraphIn the retailing section of the book Chapter The Retail Revolution contrasts traditional practices with the emerging method of lean retailing starting with a comparison of Wanamakers the grandest store of its time and the companies leading the current wave of retail restructuring Chapter The Building Blocks of Lean Retailing describes how the essential elements of lean retailingbar codes EDI the modern distribution center and standards across firmsfit together Chapter The Impact of Lean Retailing presents some of the key results of our survey indicating how lean retailers have performed over the last decade and their effects on manufacturers and suppliersNext we move to the inventory bridge between retailers and suppliers Product proliferation has raised the uncertainty of overall demand faced by retailers and suppliers Chapter Inventory Management for the Retailer looks at formal models of retail inventory management and discusses how they have been modified by lean retailing practices Chapter Inventory Management for the Manufacturer switches to the suppliers point of view Because dynamics are shifting in the channel many suppliers are confronting new inventory challenges in their efforts to replenish items rapidly for retailers We present two cases that emphasize the importance of using weekly demand variation for different items to help manufacturers set optimal inventory policies This chapter also describes a new approach to production and sourcing strategies one that balances traditional and shortcycle production linesThe next three chapters are devoted to apparel operations and related human resource practices Chapter Getting Ready to Sew describes the preassembly steps of apparel design markermaking and cutting and how they are adapted to new areas like mass customization Chapter Assembly and the Sewing Room examines the technical aspects of sewingfrom different kinds of sewing machines to what sewing operators doand alternative ways of arranging the flow of assembly operations through an apparel workplace Chapter Human Resources in Apparel considers the impact of alternative methods of assemblyespecially modular or teambased productionon firm performance We also discuss why human resource policies cannot be treated separately from other business decisions regarding rapid replenishmentIn the textile section Chapter Textile Operations describes the technological processes involved in converting fibers to a vast range of woven and knit products The textile sector has changed remarkably since World War II in part because of the capital intensity and technological sophistication of textile equipment much of which is automated Chapter The Economic Viability of Textiles places US textiles in an international context detailing the ways in which the domestic industry has adjusted over the past several decades through dramatic productivity enhancement Because textile firms are increasingly supplying retailers and industrial users directly as well as producing fabric for apparelmakers we also address the multiple channels evolving in this sectorA Stitch in Time concludes with a look at the many factors shaping todays retailappareltextile channelfrom the complex management challenges facing suppliers to labor standards and macroeconomic policy Chapter The Global Marketplace reviews trends in US imports and exports of apparel and textiles including information on trade by countries and specific products It then connects these trends to changing trade policies emphasizing the growing regionalization of trade flows in different parts of the world Chapter Suppliers in a Lean World examines our survey results from another angle evaluating firm performance in an integrated channel Here we highlight the importance of combining information technologies manufacturing innovations and new methods of management to respond to lean retailing demandsFinally Chapter InformationIntegrated Channels touches on a number of public policy issues raised by our findings These include what can be done about the continuing problem of sweatshops the new international economics of trade and the effect of information integration on the business cycle and consumer prices at the macroeconomic level Last but not least we take a realistic look at the competitive future of the US retail apparel and textile industriesThe informationintegrated channel with its emphasis on time and product perishability is the basis for our cautiously optimisticand unconventionaloutlook Even more important the forces examined in this book provide a glimpse into processes reshaping a considerable portion of the economy Consumers no longer line up for a special suit at a store like Bond Stores they also expect an ever more fashionable array of cereal products computers and automobiles As the next chapter shows the changes now under way have their roots in new technologies just as technical advances in transportation and communication shifted the industrial landscape at the end of the last century The beauty of automatic replenishment is that the buyer is really the customer She is telling us what she wants and needs in the future Quite frankly of all the buying we do letting our customer make the choice seems to make the most senseTom Cole Chairman and CEO Federated Logistics and OperationsOur goal is to replace the product on the retail shelf as quickly as possible because thats where the consumer buys itJeff Kernodle Vice President for Replenishment VF CorpMany of the popular accounts of quick response rapid replenishment and supplychain management assume that all partiesconsumers retailers and supplierswin as a result of these policies Consumers have definitely benefited because these practices afford them a greater choice of products at lower average prices It is safe to say that lean retailers have also come out ahead given their rapid growth in relation to and at the expense of traditional retailers in many different retail channels But have suppliers benefited from entering into relations with lean retailers Have such firms improved their competitive position along with the retailers they supplyThe short answer to these questions is It depends Although it is certainly true that a supplier gains from successful customers the degree to which such a company actually benefits has much to do with its internal manufacturing choices A supplier that has done little to change its internal practices may end up simply holding the bag of a retailers inventory Alternatively an adept supplier who uses information for planning production and distribution may well share in the competitive advantages derived from better information on the true state of final customer demandThis chapter examines the reasons that different suppliers win and lose reviewing many of the innovations we have discussed throughout Drawing on the HCTAR survey we first look at the way apparel suppliers adopt combinations of information and manufacturing practices in response to lean retailing We then show how supplier performance ranging from the degree of inventory risk to profitability is changed by their information technology investments and the sequence in which they are adopted The chapter concludes with a more general discussion of what suppliers in informationintegrated channels must do to succeedClusters of Supplier Practices One Innovation Is Not EnoughLean retailing allows department stores mass merchandisers and other retail outlets to capitalize on information allowing them to minimize their exposure to demand uncertainty Retail adoption of these strategies in turn means suppliers must invest in a basic set of technologies to provide the information links necessary for rapid replenishment These investments consist of the capacity to receive and transmit information electronicallythe minimum set of practices required for working with lean retailersIn addition apparel suppliers must invest in technology and capital improvements to package label route and move products rapidly from their production operations directly to the retailer Once again these capital expenditures represent a basic cost of doing business in a lean world As detailed in Chapter our research indicates that the prevalence of information technologies advanced distribution and logistics operations along with the other related services apparel suppliers provide to retailers have grown dramatically since particularly among business units that supply a large percentage of lean retailersLast but not least responding to lean retailing requirements ultimately necessitates much more sophisticated demand forecasting production planning and manufacturing strategies than the practices employed by traditional suppliers At one extreme a manufacturer can simply hold inventory for lean retailers and make few changes in its internal practices At the other end of the spectrum a manufacturer can alter its internal design planning procurement and manufacturing operations and respond rapidly to demand changes through the use of flexible manufacturing or sourcing practicesDetermining the degree to which a supplier benefits from its technological investments is the real issue Although there are no easy formulas it does appear that the specific combinations of information technology and assembly methods drawn on by the supplier make a difference in responding to lean retail requirements In order to study performance we must first examine how different manufacturing practices fit together for suppliers In this section we will discuss the interaction of four information and manufacturing practices related to apparel suppliers ability to provide products in a lean retailing world These key practices affect how apparel suppliers acquire and use information concerning demand at the SKU levelNote that the information and manufacturing practices examined here are not specific to the apparel industryin fact most were originally introduced in other sectorsbut are applicable to a wide variety of consumer product industries We focus on the retailapparel channel because HCTARs surveys provide extensive evidence for the ways in which apparel suppliers are changing Even if suppliers in other businesses will not make the specific operational changes of an apparelmaker an increasing number are establishing information links with other channel players and combining information use with technologies and work practices to speed up order processing For example textile firms that supply retailers directly with their own products may have to combine equivalent information technologies with manufacturing innovations in finishing lines that shorten production cycles in order to gain competitive advantage Much of what we have learned about the determinants of success for apparel suppliers can be applied to comparable situations faced by businesses in other retaildriven industriesKey Practice Bar CodesThe adoption of the Uniform Product Code UPC provides unique optically scannable bar codes for identifying products at the SKU level The availability of a standardized system of classification gives companies the means to input store transmit and access information concerning demand inexpensively Use of the UPC bar code system has the potential for significantly decreasing transaction costs with customers Adopting bar codes of course requires a variety of technological investments by business unitsin bar code readers and writers hand scanners computer hardware and softwareand conventions such as those promulgated by the Uniform Product Council Even so use of bar codes has become the norm for apparelmakers and retailers to date few channel partners have failed to make this changeKey Practice Electronic Data InterchangeThe second basic practice involves the use of electronic data interchange EDI as a means for transmitting data on orders between apparel suppliers and retailers Like bar codes the use of EDI requires a set of investments by suppliers and customers in computer technologies capable of sending and receiving data rapidly It also depends on conventions that standardize the system of data interchange including payment mechanisms While many channel players have adopted EDI it also represents an area of evolving practice the amount of information that can be transmitted between retailers and suppliers has grown at the same time that the costs of transmission have fallenKey Practice Standard Labeling of Shipping ContainersMarking cartons and containers for shipment according to channelwide standards can speed up distribution Modern distribution centers are capable of rapidly identifying and sorting incoming shipments from all supplierswhether apparelmakers textile producers or grocery manufacturersthrough the use of scanning systems automated sorting and conveyer systems and computer controls At the same time these systems use the information on container labels to process and reconcile invoice information on incoming and outgoing shipments This means incoming shipments must adhere to a set of technological and process standards regarding the use of bar codes for labeling cartons in addition to other standards for packing labeling placement shipping and display of productsKey Practice Modular AssemblyFinally apparel manufacturers can make innovations in the assembly stage through modular or teambased production Instead of breaking up sewing into a long series of small steps modular production entails grouping tasks and assigning them to a team to reduce the elapsed throughput time required for assembling a given product Adoption of this assembly technique involves altering the physical layout of sewing machines as well as human resource changes in training requirements compensation systems and methods of supervision As Chapter stressed modular production need not be adopted for all assembly it makes most sense for products that require rapid replenishment where the capacity to engage in shortcycle production matters In particular retaining some shortcycle capacity may be advantageous for production of SKUs with higher levels of demand variation whether because of fashion content or uncommon sizethat is for garments that have unique design elements or are in a size few consumers wearCombining Key PracticesFirms responding to frequent purchaseorder requests from retailers benefit from combining these practices At the simplest level the benefits of adopting a uniform system of production identification are reinforced by the presence of EDI transmission of information which lowers the cost of moving data between channel partners Business units adopting both bar codes and EDI are therefore able to reduce the transaction costs for processing information about sales and ordersWhen bar codes and EDI are combined with advanced shipping practices the benefit of each practice is enhanced order processing occurs more rapidly accurately and with less paper The standardized shipping container markerwhich is possible only because of the existence of bar codes in the first placeprovides a scannable description of a carton that can be electronically associated with data files containing specific information on the individual products shipped to the retailer This information sent via EDI can then be used to check incoming orders against purchase orders and authorize payments to suppliers It can also rapidly identify discrepancies between invoices and actual shipments once again lowering the cost of the transaction for both partiesMeanwhile modular production allows apparel suppliers to reduce the time required for a given product to move through the assembly process For instance by substantially reducing workinprocess buffers in assembly throughput time on the modular lines of business units in the HCTAR sample dropped to just two days compared with nine days for standard assembly methods But the benefits of throughputtime reduction cannot be fully realized unless firms are rewarded for their ability to replenish rapidly Rapid replenishment in turn requires the availability of detailed demand data and its frequent and accurate transmission Finally suppliers must be capable of using this data to allocate production capacity between shortcycle modular and standard progressive bundle system production lines In this way modular assembly systems only yield real advantages in the presence of the other three practicesIn particular advanced practices in distribution and modular production interact with each other because they both reduce throughput time The time saved in production can be lost if the distribution method is slow or if there are other impediments to the movement of products from the apparelmaker to the retailer Alternatively distribution operations that efficiently process finished products reinforce the benefits of a teambased assembly system One extreme case illustrates the importance of fit between these performance elements A mens trousers manufacturer in the early s invested in modular production in some of its lines to reduce throughput times Yet it left its distribution practices unchanged The plant required that trucks be filled before making deliveries which often meant two weeks of production would build up In other words the savings created in throughput reduction in assembly were lost on the shipping dockWhat Clustering Looks Like in the Real WorldAccording to the HCTAR survey apparel suppliers do seem to invest in clusters of practices arising from the joint benefits of adoption Table shows that combinations of practices increased quite dramatically between and For example in joint adoption of bar codes and EDI systems was uncommon Only percent of business units had adopted both while percent had adopted neither By threequarters of the business units had implemented both bar codes and EDI technologies while only percent had neither in place Similar patterns of increased adoption can be seen among other combinations of these practices in Table The mere fact that two practices have been adopted however does not tell the whole story The changing organization of the retail and apparel industries also suggests that there is a particular sequence for adopting the four key practices To begin with the adoption of bar codes came before rapid replenishment arrangements because retailers required a lowcost means of collecting information at the detailed product level for their own usethat is they first developed an efficient method for scanning prices at the checkout register and tracking products for internal inventory purposes Only after a common convention for bar codes had been established and in use for several years did retailers turn to such systems to transmit and receive data from suppliersIndeed the use of bar codes followed by implementation of EDI systems provides the basic foundation for subsequent investments in efficient logistics management in retail distribution centers Retailers do not get much out of investing in advanced distribution technologies such as shipping container markers if they lack a means for electronically identifying and using information concerning the contents of incoming shipments or of connecting that information back to suppliers for invoicing purposes And suppliers get little return out of providing customers with standardized shipping container markers if neither of these channel players has made previous investments in bar codes and EDIAs we detailed in Chapter changing the method of production to reduce manufacturing throughput times also makes little sense if a business unit has not first invested in the necessary information links for carrying on rapid replenishment relationships From an apparel suppliers perspective the benefits of adopting shipping container markers and modular production are much higher once bar codes and EDI are in placeIn fact our analysis of the HCTAR data shows that the probability of adopting shipping container markers and modular production significantly increases if both bar codes and EDI have already been implemented The probability of adopting shipping container markers in given that bar codes and EDI had been adopted in was percent compared with only percent if bar codes and EDI were not both present Similarly the probability of adopting modular systems in was percent compared with percent if bar codes and EDI were not both presentFrom Supplier Practice to Performance ResultsOnce these manufacturing and information practices have been adopted it should come as no surprise that they affect the performance of business units Based on our survey research we found that implementing a combination of the four key practicesbar codes EDI advanced shipping systems and modular assemblyincreases businessunit performance because these practices interact with and reinforce one another This is sometimes described as complementarities between practices The specific sequence of adoption should also affect performance outcomesTwo types of performance measures are of interest in this regard The first pertains to operational performance or the ability of a supplier to respond to lean retailing replenishment requirements Successful performance includes providing high levels of order completeness short lead times for new products and rapid response to requests for replenishment However operational performance measures do not necessarily provide a direct financial return to the supplier beyond allowing that firm to continue supplying a retailer with these service requirements A second set of outcomes relates to the financial performance of the business unit itself These include impacts on its revenues prices and sales cost structures and profitability Financial performance encompasses the impact of the suppliers manufacturing investments on its inventory levels which directly affects the business units costs and the degree of risk it bears from holding high finished goods or workinprocess inventoriesFrom the perspective of operational performance two business units with different degrees of investment in the four practices may do equally well in the short run But their financial performance as measured by inventory levels or profitability may differ substantially As we have emphasized in earlier chapters an apparel manufacturer that meets a lean retailers replenishment requirements while optimizing the level of inventories it holds per SKU will be exposed to less risk than one that meets retailer requirements by simply holding larger stocks of inventoriesRetail Replenishment PerformanceLean retailers now have much higher standards than they did in earlier years for the accuracy and timeliness of order fulfillment Our studies of business units with differing levels of the four practices indicate that firms with the complete set of practices achieve similar or slightly better performance in regard to the percentage of goods delivered complete and on time although these differences between business units are not very dramatic This is to be expected given the high penalties faced by suppliers for violation of these standards and the fact that retail standards may be met without extensive changes to internal apparel production practicesIn contrast more innovative business unitsthose that have adopted three or four of the key practicesare able to replenish products more rapidly than less innovative ones We have observed this in a number of different ways In the mean response time for replenishing products that the supplier had agreed to provide on this basis was weeks among those business units that had adopted none of the four practices But the average replenishment interval was only weeks for those that had adopted all the key practices These performance differences persist even after controlling for other characteristics of business units such as size and product mix which might also be associated with replenishment speed and technology adoption The results are particularly striking given that only the most demanding lean retailers in required replenishment within two weeks of order placementLead times provide another measure of supplier responsiveness Lead time is calculated as the number of days required for an apparel manufacturer to procure textiles manufacture and deliver a typical product in its collection The total time includes the number of days it takes a supplier to order and receive fabric make the marker cut the fabric sew the pieces press and package the product ship it to a distribution center and finally process it at the center The shorter the lead time the more quickly a firm is able to deliver products to retail customers Based on our survey we estimated lead times for two different scenarios standard lead times that represent performance for a typical product in the suppliers selection and shortest lead times that indicate a suppliers best practice Both measures were for products manufactured domesticallyAs shown in Figure those business units that invested in a more complete set of innovative practices had significantly shorter lead times for standard products The total elapsed standard lead time for business units with little innovation in practice averaged calendar days compared with only days for those that had invested in bar codes and EDI Even more striking lead time dropped to just days among those units that had adopted all four practicesFigure suggests that the most innovative firms are able to produce and deliver their products in less than half the time of the least innovative apparel suppliers Of course other firm characteristics such as businessunit size or product type might also be correlated with adoption of innovative practices and performance outcomes Even after we control for these factors using multiple regression techniques the number of innovative practices adopted by business units have a statistically significant positive effect on lead timeInventory PerformanceThroughout we have argued that reducing the substantial risk presented by inventory particularly in the presence of everincreasing product proliferation is essential for improving a manufacturers performance in integrated retailappareltextile channels That means inventory performance measures are crucial to determining the impact of information technology and flexible manufacturing In this case we draw on a unique matched data set that combines the HCTAR sample results with detailed microdata collected by the US Department of CommerceSpecifically we matched data from the HCTAR survey to corresponding establishmentlevel data from the Department of Commerces Longitudinal Research Database LRD The LRD provides longitudinal data for establishments included in the Bureau of the Census Annual Survey of Manufacturing To understand the relationship between technology adoption and inventory levels we matched survey data on adoption decisions in with inventory observations for the period and adoption decisions in with inventory observations for the periodOne common way of measuring inventory is to calculate the IS ratiothat is the ratio of total finished good inventories to total sales This measure allows one to compare inventories in firms with different sales volumes We calculated the IS ratio for suppliers in our matched sample and then compared those with the ratios of suppliers that used different combinations of the four manufacturing practices Figure illustrates the impact of manufacturing practices on average inventory levelsThe average IS ratio fell considerably as business units adopted more of the four key technologies during both time periods under study In the period firms that adopted none of the four technologies had an average IS ratio of while those that implemented bar codes EDI and either advanced shipping container markers or modular assemblyor bothhad an average IS ratio of only What is more these differences between low and highlevel adopters grew dramatically by the period in which the lowtechnology firms had more than twice the inventorysales ratio compared with just for the highlevel adoptersA reduction in the IS ratio means that changes in sales will be matched by smaller changes in inventories Therefore a lower IS ratio implies lower inventory volatility or variation This in turn suggests that firms with more of the key technologies in place will have total inventories that are less volatile One method of capturing volatility is to look at the standard deviation of each establishments inventory level and IS ratio for the two time periods Based on this measure inventory volatility did not decrease with more technology adoption between and However by the period firms with all four technologies had lower standard deviations in total inventories compared with less technically innovative onesThis impact on volatility is even more striking when examining variation in IS ratios for the period see Figure Standard deviations in the IS ratio of business units with low levels of adoption were compared with only for the suppliers that had implemented all the manufacturing practices by Note that the IS standard deviations control for differences in firm size And these results remain even after controlling for other factors such as product diversity that may be related to both inventories and the adoption of modern manufacturing practices by suppliersAdopting more of these practices also decreases the growth of inventory levels Figure shows the comparative growth rates in inventories from to for business units with low medium and high technology levels Adjusting for inflation and other factors that affect inventory growth we found that establishments with low levels of technology adoption in experienced far higher annual growth rates in total inventories and IS ratios than those with a more complete set of innovative practices This confirms the fact that apparel suppliers investing in both information technology and shortcycle production capacity can move to lower inventory levels more quicklyThe implications of these findings are significant A supplier attempting to meet the rigorous standards of a lean retailerwhether a shirt manufacturer for WalMart a pastamaker for Ralphs Food or an electronic drill supplier for Home Depotmust hold a far larger amount of inventory if it has not invested in a comprehensive set of information technology and shortcycle production capacity As the next section demonstrates holding larger inventories to service lean retailing demand translates into diminished profitabilityImpact on ProfitabilityImagine two mens dressshirt suppliers One still operates traditionally except for the implementation of basic information links to receive orders from lean retailers The other maintains extensive information systems which allow it to send receive and process information on retail demand orders and shipments advanced information technology also helps it plan manufacturing capacity so that the firm can engage in shortcycle production Although the first shirt supplier can respond to retailers weekly orders in a timely manner its costs for doing so are high both in terms of the internal expense of transacting frequent orders and its increased exposure to the risk posed by holding inventory It costs the second supplier less however to transact weekly business with retailers because of the electronic systems it has in place In addition its capacity to use information on the state of demand allows it to set inventory levels on a SKU basis that balances the benefits of having a product available against the costs of holding workinprocess and finished goods inventoriesAs a result of these differences we expect that the second dressshirt suppliers financial performance will be decidedly better than that of the first over the long run Our survey evidence confirms this expectation Consider the frequency with which suppliers reduce the price of their product for retailers during the selling season Apparel suppliers in our survey that had adopted all four of the key information and manufacturing practices reported fewer price markdowns by retailers than those with few or none of the practices Therefore retailers that work with suppliers employing a more complete set of information distribution and manufacturing innovations need not eliminate as many of their unsold products at the end of season via price reductionsManufacturing markdowns to retailers provide more direct evidence of the benefits of these innovative practices Those business units that had adopted all the practices reported an average discount provided to retail customers of just percent compared with an average discount of percent among suppliers that had implemented none of them Although these differences cannot all be directly attributed to the adoption of the practices per se they do suggestespecially when combined with the significant inventory performance results reported previouslyhow important it is for manufacturers to be adept at using incoming information from lean retailing customersThe real question then is how do these factors together affect the bottom line And do business units with the more complete set of innovative technologies have higher profitability Here the answer is a definite yes Profitability is measured as operating profit marginrevenue minus costs of goods sold divided by revenue Figure shows our basic results in regard to average profit margin for different levels of technology adoption Business units that did not adopt any of the four key practices earned the lowest profit margins about percent in The most innovative firms were approximately four times as profitable achieving average profit margins of percentEven after controlling for the independent effects of firm size product mix and distribution channel on performance we found that the most innovative firms were significantly more profitable than those that had adopted fewer of the key practices In our sample adding shippingcontainer markers to established bar code and EDI practices increased operating profits by percentthat is from about percent in average profit margins to percent adding some modular assembly capacity to these three practices increased operating profits by about the same amountSince HCTARs survey informal case evidence suggests that these disparities in operating and financial performance have only grown larger as lean retailing continues to sweep across distribution channels The least innovative apparel suppliers are seeing their chances for survival dwindle every year In contrast suppliers that have continued to innovate and expand their use of the four practices as well as other activities described in previous chapters keep outperforming the industry as a wholeManagement Practice The Final Ingredient in Enhanced PerformanceThe upshot of all this is that manufacturers need not hold the bag for lean retailers if they adopt a set of technologies and practices that allow them to collect and process demand information incorporate it into planning and use traditional and shortcycle production strategically Simply doing business with lean retailers in no way confers competitive success In fact a supplier that attempts to provide rapid replenishment without any other innovations may end up performing poorly from the perspective of its retail customers More important it will sustain higher costs in inventories face a greater need to mark down the prices of its products and therefore earn a lower profit margin than those establishments that have invested in comprehensive changesOf course becoming an advanced manufacturer is not just a matter of buying more information technologies or setting up a shortcycle assembly line The essential force behind the performance impact of these practices is their effective integration with one another Integration does not arise from hardware or software purchases It comes from successful managementWe have already described some specific ways that managers can think about integration of new information technologies and manufacturing practices Chapter presented two production planning cases The first indicated how managers must assess a product line according to the variance in demand for particular SKUs in setting inventory policies The second case developed how suppliers must use this new perspective on demand to plan production or sourcing strategies Both cases illustrate the necessity of creating managerial practices that explicitly link the data arising from information technology with changes in manufacturing practices to take full advantage of these innovationsA contemporary apparelmaker handling on average SKUs in its collection faces the challenge of replenishing weekly numerous retail customers at high satisfaction levels with a constantly shifting subset of its goods Managers of such a firm must do so by drawing on information from the past weeks sales as well as explicitly factoring in the impact of uncertainty They need realtime information regarding what goods their plants have in finished workinprocess and material inventories They must know the leadtime requirements for procuring textile products and establish relationships with at least some textile suppliers that allow the apparelmaker to procure fabric in smaller quantities and with shorter lead times This supplier must draw on production lines and sourcing arrangements that provide it with a range of response times from shortcycle production capacity for products with high demand variability to lines or sourcing arrangements that create larger production runs at lower costs for items with low demand variability But most important it must have a managerial system capable of coordinating these elements on an ongoing basisBased on our observations of apparel suppliers coming up with the money for new technologies and practices seems to be less of an impediment than altering basic management conceptions about using these technologies for planning and production Many of the business units in our sample have adopted specific practices without changing their approach to using them together to compete in an integrated channel They continue to draw on traditional conceptions of planning production and sourcingin other words they still think in terms of large orders of their products placed months before delivery is expected Needless to say these business units have not fully benefited from the investments they have madeSuppliers in most consumer industries now face lean retailing pressures or its equivalent Many are taking steps to adapt to the changed requirements placed on them One example is the restructuring beginning to appear in automobile distribution Traditional auto retailing focuses on selling product lines in production quantities that were largely determined in advance of distribution The system therefore placed tremendous pressure on auto dealers to sell the enormous finished goods inventory found in a car lot In contrast to this traditional retailing model BMW announced in an effort to restructure its US dealers by allowing consumer customization of car purchases through the use of multimedia computer systems By allowing customers to design their own cars BMW dealers hope to reduce their finished goods inventoriesNote that this system poses production questions for BMW similar to those faced by apparel suppliers The company will need to decide which auto SKU or subassemblies to produce using traditional assembly techniques and which to produce with shortcycle production methods BMW will also need to combine information technologies planning and forecasting methods and production techniques to implement such strategies Similar pressure to innovate automobile distribution and production is also increasing because of the emergence of new retailers like Car Max Auto Superstores and the United Auto Group which operate under principles more akin to lean retailingTwo examples from the computer industry further illustrate supplier approaches that integrate information technology and manufacturing decisions In the early s facing product proliferation and replenishment requirements for its laserjet printing products Hewlett Packard redesigned its manufacturing process for printers It did so by separating those subassembly processes that were standard across products from those that were distinctive to specific laserjet products By using incoming demand information in concert with this subassembly and assembly redesign Hewlett Packard can now assemble different products with shorter lead times in response to actual information concerning demand at the same time it continues to take advantage of scale efficiencies in production The resulting inventory and production policies allow Hewlett Packard to balance the costs of stockouts with those of unsold inventoriesIn Compaq Computer the worlds largest producer of personal computers announced a plan to change relations with its distributors Compaqs main competitors Dell Computer and Gateway sell directly to consumers through mailorder and Internet operations In contrast Compaq sells its products through computer dealers Technological advances and rapid diffusion of older technologies make personal computers extremely perishablemuch like apparel with a fashion contentand subject to almost constant price markdown pressure Because Compaq like other personal computer manufacturers provides its distributors price guarantees on purchased inventories ie it reimburses the distributor if it must mark down prices in response to falling memory or other costs its inventory carrying costs are significantRather than continuing to increase inventory Compaq announced that it would only assemble its new line of personal computers as its retail customers ordered them And instead of providing an openended guarantee on prices to its distributors the company would guarantee the price for only two weeks after purchase by the distributor refusing to take back computers unless they malfunctioned By changing its method of distributing products Compaq hopes to reduce the level of dealer inventory across product lines to two weeks worth and in the process save billion or more a year These cost savings will be used to reduce prices and compete more aggressively with Dell and Gateway that do not work through distributors Therefore Compaqs competitive strategy arises from its efforts to advance informationintegration forward in the channels in which it operates Note also that if Compaq seeks to take full advantage of these changes in distribution it must also adjust its production strategies to account for differences in demand variability across the computer makers product linesIn fact companies in myriad sectors are grappling with the same managerial challenges and opportunities of those in the American apparel and textile industries Rethinking how to service stringent retail replenishment requirements for ever broadening product lines in more selling seasons has become a central business challengeThe implications of these changes do not end here An economy consisting of lean retailing and corresponding lean suppliers operates in a fundamentally different manner from one based on traditional retailing and supply practices The industrial transformation currently in progress encompasses international trade issues competitiveness labor regulation and macroeconomic policies Accordingly the last chapter of this book is devoted to our reflections on the impact of channel integration on certain public policy issues More than a century ago a major wave of innovations in distribution and production led to the modern department store the mailorder house and the chain store and reshaped their suppliers The present transformation of retail and manufacturing engendered by new information technologies production methods and management practices also fundamentally alters the manner in which industries and firms take raw materials turn them into a profusion of products and deliver them to consumers Although these developments are very much a work in progress informationintegrated channels of production and distribution are emergingSuch channels are not unique to retailappareltextile relations but have arisen in a wide variety of consumer product industries in which retailing practices are undergoing similar changes The developments reported here offer a prototype of the new links among manufacturers other suppliers retailers and consumersIn fact the transformation has been gradual and is still under way Only as recently as the mids has integration risen to critical levels providing a clear picture of what channel relations will look like in the future Information integration has reshaped much of the retailappareltextile channel yet further transformation is likely in the decade ahead not only for these linked industries but for consumer product sectors in generalIn this final chapter we step back to survey the ways in which informationintegrated channels will affect the public and private sectors The pervasive changes arising from lean retailing challenge the conventional wisdom about the future of international trade labor standards employment and even macroeconomic fluctuations At the same time these changes alter the nature of competitive strategy for businesses that supply lean retailers in apparel textile and other industriesTrade Issues The New International EconomicsWe estimate that national income would improve if quotas and tariffs were eliminated because the cost to the economy of protecting each worker with import restraints exceeds the wage the worker is paid For textiles the cost per job protected is while wages are for apparel the cost per job is while wages are We want the world to know how strongly we oppose NAFTA expansion and fast trackJohn J Sweeney President AFLCIOThese quotations aptly reflect the continuing controversy over international trade policies The apparel and textile industries have played a central role in trade discussions since the inception of the United States just as they have in other developing and developed countries throughout the world These industries have often been chosen as the means for building manufacturing capacity in the developing world at the same time they have been the recipient of trade protection in developed economies More to our point information integration has added a new dimension to these longstanding controversiesThe textile and apparel industries have often been intertwined in public policy discussions about international trade the Uruguay round of trade negotiations the role of World Trade Organization NAFTA and its labor sideaccords the renewal of fasttrack negotiating authority imports from China and human rights standards and so on This stream of general debate however is seldom related to a detailed study or analysis of the impact of such developments on the US textile or apparel industriesFrom the time of Adam Smith and David Ricardo down through the writings of HechscherOhlin economic analysis has been devoted to the consequences of trade restraints in the form of quotas tariffs and nontariff barriers on output employment and prices Traditional international economics attributes trade to comparative advantage relative labor costs and the relative costs of logistics and transportation A new international economics in the past decade has stressed that much global trade actually reflects as Paul Krugman puts it National advantages that are created by historical circumstance rather than natural resources Because comparative advantage is often created not given a temporary subsidy can lead to a permanent industry Note that these economic analyses and policy prescriptions have been applied generally and are not focused on particular industries like textiles or apparelIn any case since the s such debates about the impact of international trade policy have been placed in a new economic context Increasingly analysts and public policy makers discuss trade issue in terms of the emergence of a significant and growing inequality in compensation between production and nonsupervisory workers on the one hand and managerial supervisory or exempt employees and professionals on the other These differences include a larger disparity in compensation between those highly educated and those who are not particularly high school dropouts In addition there has been an appreciable growth in relatively unskilled immigrants in some localities such as major metropolitan areas around the country The Economic Report of the President reporting a colloquium of experts at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York attributes the growth of inequality to the following technological change percent international trade percent a decline in the real minimum wage percent rising immigration percent and other factors percentAlthough such analysis and policy discussions have not singled out specific industries the nature of the occupational structure and workforce in textiles and apparelparticularly the latter sectormakes the general discussion relevant to these two industries It would appear that neither the market imports of textiles nor the immigration of lowskilled workers has had an appreciable negative impact on the wages of the textile industry or its major sectors The average hourly earnings of US employees in textile mill products SIC went from in to in an increase of percent and more than the increase in all manufacturing or nondurable manufacturing This relative wage increase in textiles took place despite its concentration in a lowwage regionthe southeastern Piedmont statesthe low level of collective bargaining and the higherthanaverage percentage of women workersBut the experience in apparel is less categorical especially because of the differential impact on various branches of apparel and other textile products SIC In the average hourly earnings of apparel workers were On the high end automotive and apparel trimmings SIC averaged on the low end womens and misses blouses and skirts SIC averaged Correspondingly employment in automotive and apparel trimmings increased percent from to while in womens and misses blouses and skirts it declined by percent in the same period Bear in mind however that blast furnaces and steel mills SIC declined in employment from employees in to in This percent decline from to compares with a percent drop for textile mill products and percent for all apparel workersStill there can be little doubt that in a sector like womens and misses blouses and skirts in which employment is concentrated in small contract shops import competition from lowwage developing countries and unskilled immigrants have contributed to its deterioration Moreover the failure to comply with federal and state employment statutes relating to minimum wages overtime rates and child labor uncovered in periodic enforcement forays have contributed to the decline of this sectorThe general analysis of the consequences of trade and immigration in the textile and apparel industries clearly requires a much more focused application to detailed sectors to provide reliable conclusions Moreover and as this volume indicates the offsetting influences of lean retailing and shortcycle production in comparison with low foreign labor rates must be evaluated by product demand variability rather than simply making generalizations about aggregate trade and immigration For instance the informationintegrated channels in retailappareltextile are having some of their most significant impact on sourcing among suppliers domestic and foreign The low labor costs for sewing and short time to market from Mexico and the Caribbean countries and the provisions of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule formerly Section and a or currently that establish duties only on the value added to USproduced materials sent out for assembly all favor sourcing of apparel from south of the US border rather than Asia According to the US International Trade Commission US imports of textiles and apparel from China and two of the traditional Big Three Asian suppliersHong Kong and Koreacontinued to decline in when these countries together with Taiwan accounted for percent of total sector trade compared with percent in The informationintegrated channels developed in the United States which are now influencing sourcing patterns from Mexico and the Caribbean Basin have begun to affect the textile and apparel sectors worldwide For many fashion apparel productsdefined as those planned to last only one seasonthe practice of sourcing on the basis of lowest labor costs may be expected to continue Indeed much of Asian sourcing has been devoted to such items with production shifting within Asia away from regions where wage levels have risen But for basic and fashion basic apparel products for which frequent replenishment orders are becoming the norm the practice of sourcing some of the assembly and sewing operations from nearby lower wage regions and countries is emerging At the same time design distribution centers marketingeven cuttingas well as some shortcycle assembly remain in the market regionAs we pointed out in Chapter regionalization of apparel production in three main areas has started to occur In the US market most sewing operations take place in Mexico and the Caribbean Basin in Europe sewing operations go to North Africa Turkey and Eastern Europe and in Japan sewing operations go to various East Asian regions The formal analysis in Chapter specified the factors that determine whether production of items under rapid replenishment policies should be done domestically or outsourced to low wage countriesFor textiles with their high capital costs lower labor content and emphasis on high quality and finishing operations the concentration in the southeastern United States Korea and Japan and industrial Europe may be expected largely to continue But the longer term viability of American textile centers will depend on the development of infrastructures capable of supporting advanced textile production in countries close to the US market such as Mexico and elsewhere in Latin AmericaMacroeconomic Implications Inventories Business Cycles and Price LevelsIn an informationintegrated channel the historic market relationships between buyers and sellers change significantly It is true that textiles firms still sell to apparelmakers which in turn sell to retailers which ultimately sell to consumers Markets certainly have not disappeared but these relationships have been transformed Different channel players now share detailed information on daily sales investments in technologies mutually benefit both retailers and suppliers and because of the effective use of information and manufacturing technologies risk has been reduced across the entire channel The adoption of standards in the supply channel such as those that specify packaging labeling and marking of products have reduced further time to market and enhanced efficiencies this expedites transit and ensures floorready merchandise for consumers at the end of the channel from suppliers As a result the traditional boundary lines between firms are blurring as the cost of transacting business within and across industries falls dramatically Note that the technologies and standards that made these informationintegrated channels possible were a product of privatesector activitiesindividual enterprises trade associations and consulting firms The fundamental standards of product identification through bar codes and related technologies have become compatible worldwide without the prescription or regulation of a Bureau of Standards or government regulatory agenciesFalling transaction costs between sectors allow an economy to increase the total output of goods and services it can produce for a given set of resource inputs The dramatic decrease in transaction costs across many sectors parallels the widescale changes at the end of the last century which in the words of Alfred Chandler reduced the number of transactions involved in the flow of goods increased the speed and regularity of the flow and so lowered costs and improved the productivity of the American distribution system Yet it often takes time for an economy to reflect the impact of such fundamental shifts In fact the current combination of changes in information technology management practice and manufacturing strategy may be one of the places where the impact of computers on the economy has been hidden until recentlyThe falling costs of conducting business between retailers and their suppliers may also explain why there has been relatively little vertical concentration across industries in the channelno textile firms have gone into the manufacture of apparel or retail and few apparel firms have set up their own retail outlets Indeed an effective informationintegrated channel probably works against vertical integration Sharing information and current knowledge of the market across channel players achieves some of the same objectivesat lower costof formally reaching forward or backward into markets Enterprises in different parts of the channel can therefore concentrate on their business strengthsLean retailing and the restructuring of manufacturing supply have also affected the economy as a whole in the area of inventories Lean retailing itself implies a dramatic reduction in the amount of inventory held by retail enterprises Chapter documents the large inventory reductions of apparel suppliers that draw fully on information technology in concert with new managerial and manufacturing practices in some cases they have decreased inventory levels by halfThe impact of these new policies on retailing and manufacturing sectors may have begun to show up in economywide measures of inventory The overall ratio of inventories to final sales of domestic business fell considerably in the past decade from in to in It has long been known that inventories at the macroeconomic level affect the depth and length of business cycles The connection between recent changes in inventory policy and the business cycle have only begun to be studied in a systematic fashion As noted in the Economic Report of the PresidentAdoption of justintime inventory management by manufacturers also represents a significant development since changes in inventories have often been an important source of businesscycle fluctuations Whether justintime inventories will be able to dampen future business cycles however remains to be seenOur work on apparel supplier adjustments to lean retailing suggests that an economy characterized by an increasing level of modern manufacturing and retailing practices should experience lower levels of inventories relative to sales Because a reduction in the IS ratio means that changes in sales will be matched by a smaller change in inventories a lower ratio also implies lower inventory volatility This is important because aggregate inventory volatility has historically made up a significant portion of the volatility of Gross Domestic Product GDP If the effects documented for retailappareltextile channels are more pervasive across other sectors similarly affected by channel integration these changes could imply lower GDP volatility This macroeconomic link may prove to be the most profound implication of the adoption of firmlevel information technology and manufacturing practicesFundamental changes in inventory policies in retail and manufacturing may significantly affect price levels as well The increased volatility of producer and consumer prices in a number of sectors since has been attributed in part to the adoption of new inventory polices related to lean retailing Some have suggested a connection between these policies and price fluctuations According to one view an informationintegrated channel may lead to increased volatility in aggregate prices because the impact of shifts in supply and demand is more rapidly reflected in consumer prices without the buffering impact of inventory Competitive informationintegrated channels may also reduce aggregate price levels as expressed by price markup policies that in the past have reflected the incomplete information of channel participants Whatever the effect the more widespread adoption of informationintegrated channels documented in this book raise a central question for future models of industry and macroeconomicprice movementsLabor Standards The Problem of SweatshopsThe most effective weapon used by American capital in weakening the power of organized labor has been to hire immigrant workersImmigrants are cheap and controllable The conditions they toil under make a mockery of the already low American labor standardsthe most regressive among the advanced industrial nationsFor more than a century the US federal and state governments have investigated sweatshops in the garment industry including the role of immigrants and have adopted legislation to ameliorate their impact on workers and consumers At the turn of the last century unsanitary conditions in addition to low wages long hours and child labor were the biggest concerns State inspectors were authorized to attach a tenementmade tag to garments produced by violators The Consumers League organized in adopted a voluntary label to be attached to garments made by manufacturers that abided by labor standardsthat is they obeyed state factory laws manufactured on their premises employed no children under and used no overtime workIn the Fair Labor Standards Act FLSA for industry generally specified minimum wage rates overtime after forty hours of work per week and a prohibition of child labor The socalled hot cargo provisions of the statute Section made it illegal to transport or sell goods in commerce produced in violation of the provisions of the Act Despite these strict legislated standardswith wage levels updated from time to timewidespread violations in apparel workplaces have become commonplace in the s Labor conditions have deteriorated for a number of reasons the decline in the coverage of collective bargaining agreements with their provisions for regulation of contract shops the difficulty of policing contributions for health and pension funds from employers in this sector the increase in immigrants legal and illegal concentrated in certain areas the intense competition from imports and the sharp drop in employment in apparel in some markets Sweatshops it seems have always been with usThe El Monte plant in southern California with immigrants working behind barbed wire caught the nations attention in Federal investigators reported in that twothirds of the establishments in New York Citys garment industry violated overtime or minimum wage laws The US Labor Department reports that independent surveys as well as federal and state compliance data show minimum wage and overtime violations of the FLSA occurring in to percent of investigated establishments The policy question is what if anything can be done to control or eliminate sweatshops and noncompliance with statutory standards in the United States And what can be done to ameliorate sweatshop conditions in developing countries that produce and export half of the apparel purchased in this countryHistorically US governments have employed three general approaches to the problem of sweatshops First the federal and state governments used powers of enforcement to seek compliance with labor standards For the federal government the Fair Labor Standards Act and its regulations specify the standards and enforcement procedures But sole reliance on traditional government enforcement activities has serious limitations The Department of Labor has fewer than investigators to enforce employment statutes for apparel industry employees in about establishments not to mention the other million employees in million workplaces around the country Monitoring compliance with wage and hour provisions and pursuing violations is an extremely complicated and timeconsuming processA second method has involved mobilizing public pressure on consumers retailers and manufacturers to raise the incentives for voluntary compliance with labor standards For example the Secretary of Labor has used his or her bully pulpit to call attention to the problem urging the public retailers and manufacturers to avoid purchasing products made in workplaces that do not meet the standards Various reports have also publicized government enforcement actions to deter contractors jobbers manufacturers and retailers from violating the standards such as the release of a series of government reports on the extent of violations and the penalties assessed against violators In yet another example Duke Universitys adoption of a code of conduct to ensure that apparel items bearing the universitys name are not made in sweatshops has received public supportIndeed efforts to use public concern and at times outrage to tackle the sweatshop problem go back to the early part of this century The most famous case involves public reaction to the fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Company on March in which women died The fire started in a loft of the factory during the workday The women and girls working in the factory could not escape because the company had locked the doors to the stairs from the outside ostensibly to prevent theft by employees The lack of fire extinguishers within the factory and the inability of fire ladders to reach the windows made escape impossible In this case public outrage led to early workers compensation and factory inspection legislationBut in general the effectiveness of focusing public attention on sweatshops and poor labor conditions has been limited by the difficulty of keeping consumers voters students or other groups working on this issue for sustained periods of time Such avenues are at best a means for focusing the attention of key parties in order to build longer term mechanisms that remain even after public attention wanesFinally voluntary agreements among channel participants to ensure compliancewhich sometimes have arisen from efforts to increase public pressurehave been employed at various times For instance in the Labor Department sponsored the Apparel Industry Partnership in which a number of US apparel manufacturers UNITE the National Consumers League the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility and others agreed to monitor compliance with labor standards of contractors Yet these initiatives also have limitations It is difficult to select an organization to do the monitoring establish the procedures to be followed and determine who should serve as outside or independent monitors Voluntary compliance measures and agreements in the United States outside of collective bargaining have thus far had a history of shortterm viability and limited effectivenessPolicies to reduce repugnant workplace conditionsby US standardsin developing nations that export apparel to the US involve an even more complex range of issues What are the appropriate labor standards Is one only to apply the standards and regulations of the exporting country or are some higher international standards to be used How are such standards to be established recognized and enforced One approach would be to extend the conventions and standards established by the International Labour Office ILO and to enhance the effectiveness of its enforcement The ILO held a convention on child labor in June and is considering a proposal for an annual global report on countries that have not ratified certain core workers rights such as freedom of association abolition of forced labor nondiscrimination and equal remuneration and minimum age Even with such international standards adopted by the ILO the task of enforcement remains dauntingIn the United States a number of programs have been adopted that seek to change labor practices in workplaces overseas The Department of Labor provided to the International Program for the Elimination of Child Labor in a joint effort with the ILO to end the use of children in the manufacture of soccer balls in Pakistan In million soccer balls were produced there onequarter by children Mattel Nike and Kathie Lee Gifford exemplify manufacturers brand names and celebrities who have adopted programs for overseas inspections to mitigate criticism of their possible sweatshop imports The Council on Economic Priorities has established a global variable social accountability standard that companies can follow to prove they adhere to an array of labor standards and pay their workers a sufficient income The US and European Union through the Secretary of Labor and Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs have sought to develop among labor and management an acceptance of international standards to assure consumers that the products they buy are not made in sweatshopsIn a significant sense such efforts to deal with labor standards in apparel production simply illustrate the larger issues of trade labor and environmental standards that are likely to be a focus of international economic discourse over the decade ahead In fact it is doubtful that these issues can be separated to the extent they have been over the past decade There are sharp differences in the United States between organized labor and business and in the political arena as well Persistent efforts in the labor standards field indicate that separating trade labor and other social issues will no longer be as acceptable in the era ahead The fact that US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright took up the issue of global sweatshops is a striking example of this realityThe complexity of sweatshop problems makes any silver bullet solution as unlikely now as it has been throughout this century Nonetheless our analysis suggests a number of steps that might be taken to improve compliance with US labor standards in the presence of informationintegrated channels Given the inherent resource limitations in US government enforcement inspections must be carefully targeted to yield maximum impact One method for improving targeting would be to require each garment to include a bar code label that shows the place and time of fabrication This would take advantage of the same technology that has been so fundamental to the changes examined in this book Information from the bar code could more directly be used by the Wage and Hour inspectors to sample compliance and more rapidly isolate violations Such requirements could arise either as a result of voluntary agreements among retailers and apparel suppliers or be mandated through regulation Past experience suggests however that in this field voluntary measures need to be reinforced by regulatory authorityThe viability of collective bargaining as a means once again to regulate sweatshop conditions largely depends on the ability of UNITE to rebuild its collective bargaining and membership base in a smaller and more efficient industry responsive to lean retailing Efforts by the union and apparel employers to link compliance with wage and working condition standards to efforts to improve the competitive viability of the industry offer promise such as through sponsoring training of apparel managers or by helping to build more responsive networks of apparel contractors to deal with retailers But these initiatives are still at an early stage of developmentFinally the central role played by retailers in development and operation of the channel points to the fact that any measurewhether taken by the government through voluntary compliance programs or via collective bargainingmust include their participation and support The reliance of lean retailing on the promulgation of standards of performance has been well documented in this book A logical extension of those practices might be the adoption of procedures or systems related to labor standards in domestic or offshore sourcing operationsThe Coming Competitive LandscapeSince the end of World War II textilemill products and apparel have both been characterized by substantial reductions in employment at the same time these sectors show substantial increases in output including shifts to highervalue products and higher productivity Total employment in US textiles is projected to continue its decline reaching workers by with apparel down to at the same date Meanwhile outputs are projected to increase and percent respectively in the periodThese are scarcely moribund industries with inflexible product and labor markets The textile industry in particular has been characterized by rapid technological changes and automation shifts to largescale establishments restructuring and consolidation of enterprises in spinning weaving and knitting substantial capital investments in these activities and finishing operations and a shift to products with expanding markets Wages have risen relative to the average of all manufacturing or nondurable manufacturing Exports have been within a few billion dollars of imports in recent yearsThe economics of these channels depend on the costs of the separate steps and transactionsfrom manufacture including inventory costs through distribution costs retail and sales including markdown and stockout costs The costs of time to market also matters This view of costs examined throughout this book yields quite different estimates from the traditional resort to comparative direct labor costs of manufacture as a sole basis for supplychoice decisions Previous chapters have demonstrated that the lowest purchase price from a supplier does not necessarily yield the lowest costs at the point and time of sale or the largest profit An established channel in which the various parties focus on time to market results in markedly different supply decisions and dynamics than those dictated by conventional direct labor costs of supplies Given these crucial changes the following sections review the competitive horizon for each of the industries that make up the channelThe Retail HorizonInformationintegration is one of the major factors contributing to increasing concentration in the retail sector Previously manufacturers and suppliers to a number of retailers were often in a better position compared with any one retailer to report on shifting styles and tastes and estimate market direction In many situations they chose SKUs and set volumes for retailers Now pointofsales information provides retailers with reliable information on market developments and hence gives them more leverage in dealing with direct suppliers and others further from ultimate consumers In other words direct measurable information of consumer behavior translates into market power The lean retailer can also transfer to its suppliers the functions and costs of creating floorready merchandise activities that traditional retailers handled in the past Bear in mind however that the informationintegrated channel requires substantial investment in technologies by retailers Although smallscale retailing continues it is clear that an increasing proportion of retailing will be concentrated among a decreasing number of larger enterprisesThe Internet has been often cited as an alternative to retailing and presumably a potential challenge to the dominant role played by lean retailers In this regard Tracy Mullin President of the National Retail Federation NRF notesThe NRF fields a deluge of calls each week about the Internets impact on retailing The most common question we get from reporters How long will it take for the Internet to completely replace physical retailing We have observed that traditional retailers are taking a cautious approach to the Internet Yet most understand its great potential even if they openly admit they dont have all the answersA limited number of retailers are currently experimenting with the Internet although only percent of those surveyed in indicated that they currently sell products this way Retailers are currently reluctant to go online both because they believe that their products are illsuited for Web sales and are concerned about specific technical limitations such as the security of electronic financial transactionsA number of developments many linked to issues we have discussed indicate both the potential and limitations of electronic retailing In one sense the Internet offers opportunities akin to mailorder retailing for playing a very lean game For example Lands Ends became an early leader in adopting certain lean retailing elements into its catalog operations and has aggressively entered Internet retailing This retailer launched its Web site in the first major apparel retailer to do so Its site incorporates an encryption system to protect customers against creditcard theftsThe Internet provides some of the advantages of mailorder sales with even lower transaction costs However the obstacles to virtual retailing remain formidable Product offerings are limited in Web retail sitesthe Lands End site for example offered only products in In addition just as in other areas of modern retailing a company must have a distribution system capable of getting products out efficiently on an orderbyorder basis either through internal resources or use of thirdparty consolidators The economics of distribution for Web retailing like catalog retailing are therefore quite different from those developed even by advanced instore lean retailersFinally measurement fit color and texture remain central components of apparel sales In apparelunlike the sale of goods via the Internet such as computers software or toolspeople want to see feel and try on the products These aspects of selling apparel items do not fit well with virtual retailing The mailorder business already contends with this problem and these retailers cope with returns that sometimes go over onequarter the value of sales in a given year Consider Lands End once more In well before its entrance to the Internet it was forced to cope with returns of shirts Each return was associated with a processing cost roughly equivalent to percent of its value Thus although Internet retailing will certainly grow as a channel of distribution the most essential longer term developments will involve the expansion of lean retailing principles to a wider and wider variety of goods sold by a decreasing number of major retailersThe Apparel Industry HorizonA central feature of informationintegrated channelsindeed the basis for our term lean retailingis the effective management of inventories at the SKU level Throughout the modern channel lean inventory management reduces the risk of selling perishable products thus enhancing profits The capability to compete increasingly depends on an enterprises ability to manage operations according to the logistics of time and flow of product reducing time to market and the costs of holding inventoryWe have made clear that holding inventory can be expensive to a supplier whether it manufactures or sources its products in several ways These include capital tied up in workinprocess or finished goods the costs of facilities used the risks of failure to sell and price markdowns to dispose of products At the same time the inability to supply product to retailers or customers is another costly riskThese risks and costs may be minimized and profits enhanced by using a combination of shortcycle and longercycle production lines The shortcycle line turns out products faster but usually at a higher unit cost The longcycle line takes longer to produce items but at lower costs Balancing these lines by establishing for each SKU the precise pattern of expected variability in demand and pointofsale information provides the means for maximizing profits Our research suggests that the cycle time of a fast production line should be no more than a week or two to be an effective alternative for the lower costs of a longcycle line or plantThe balancing of shortcycle and longcycle production alternatives has direct application to the choices manufacturers and retailers face between domestic sources with potential short cycles and foreign sources with longer ones The future of the domestic apparel industry rests on those items made using shortcycle production which are often those with high weekly variations in sales Such shortcycle production necessarily requires methods like modular or UPS assembly rather than the lengthy progressive bundle system At the same time it requires an ability to use incoming information on sales in a sophisticated manner to allocate production in this wayIn a related vein the future of domestic producers also relies on their development of capabilities for supplying fashion products on a replenishment basis Once again this requires a combination of practices by using advanced forecasting methods and innovative production techniques apparelmakers may be able to respond in very short periods of time to pointofsale information regarding sale of products with higher fashion content In addition as we discussed in Chapter suppliers attempting mass customization of apparel products such as jeans will need similar capabilitiesThe Textile Industry HorizonTextile markets in the United States no longer depend primarily on apparel as they did in the past Currently no more than approximately percent of textile shipments are for apparel items Textile firms now furnish a range of household products such as sheets bedding towels and rugs and some knit products Tshirts directly to retailers Such channels have adopted the informationintegration described earlier as textile products have been upgraded from greige goods in a brokers market to those that involve complex finishing operations and extensive product proliferation A number of integrated channels have therefore been developed among textiles retailers and their customersSignificant markets have also grown for industrial textiles in a wide range of industrial enterprises such as automobile interiors and tire cord The range of industrial products is expanding including knapsacks tea bags tents fishing nets hammocks air bags and parachutes Even if textile products flowing to apparel sewn in this country or in Mexico and the Caribbean Basin where contractors assemble garments using US textiles decline it is realistic to assume that some US textile exports will increase in the near term and that there will be substantial increases in domestic industrial marketsStill at least one feature of textile markets warrants attention in their relations to apparel The size of many orders preferred by the apparel industry is considerably smaller than that preferred by textile firms Apparelmakers confront frequent changes in styles and new SKUs while textile manufacturers seek long runs to keep capacity operating roundtheclock In the retailappareltextile channels there is a need for an informationsharing integrated systemsome form of packagerto assist in ameliorating these differences Once again the development of Web sites to undertake some of these connections represents an important first step in this directionThe Future of InformationIntegrated ChannelsAs we have stated throughout textiles and apparel remain significant sectors of the US economy In together they provided more than million jobs and in they are projected to have combined employment of over millionnearly percent of all projected jobs in manufacturing These sectors are far too vital to their communities and the country and have proven sufficiently vibrant to be dismissed by the conventional doctrine of comparative labor costsIndeed rather than turning the future more bleak the introduction and the widespread adoption of lean retailing by all participants in the retailappareltextile channel provides new opportunities for the textile and apparel industries at least in some segments We see a viable future for these industrieswith a few caveats These revived opportunities do not apply with equal effect to all branches of apparel or all parts of the fashion triangle Garments amenable to rapid replenishment principles have the most potential for US productionOur less pessimistic view of the future of these industries should not be misinterpreted The textile sector appears more promising because it has become more directly connected to retailers and industrial users Yet survival in both sectors belongs only to the fittest adopters of the new order of retailing and the channel Employment levels are not projected to turn around Instead employment will gradually decline in both industries while output and productivity increasethe best that any industrial sector can expect over time in the modern economy The new order in apparel places more of a premium on scale and size along with investments in the requisite technologies The traditional contractor shop and small enterprise will have a smaller and even less secure role unless linked to sophisticated intermediary agents in the channelIn short the paths these industries follow will be determined by their interconnection with one another Providing a stitchor a package of pasta a home computer an automobilein time requires a growing degree of integration among business enterprises within and across industries Whether it is Federated Department Stores or Home Depots use of pointofsales information for inventory control Levi Strausss or Black and Deckers efforts at customizing products to suit very specific consumer groups or VFs or Dell Computers innovations to provide product diversity more efficiently channel integration is driving the current industrial transformationand will continue to do so in the period ahead The emergence of textile apparel and retail enterprises in the United States is full of fascinating twists In for instance an act of industrial espionage is said to have launched the domestic textile industry if not American manufacturing in general At that time Samuel Slater a skilled mechanic built the first successful waterpowered yarn spinning mill in Pawtucket Rhode Island Yarn was in short supply in the new country and much in demand in households that did hand weaving as well as in workplaces with looms that produced sheeting shirting and stockings for commerce Some of the American states and improvement societies had even offered generous rewards for the establishment of waterpowered combing and spinning especially those based on stateoftheart English Arkwright operations But British law strictly prohibited the export of drawings plans or models of these new technologies It took somebody like Slateran indentured apprentice for over six years at the Arkwright and Struts plant in Milford Englandto ferry the plans to AmericaSlater was interested in the financial rewards to be had in the new world while still in England Mindful of British prohibitions he committed to memory the design and construction of the spinning mill where he worked Arriving in New York in late he was referred to Moses Brown in Providence a prominent merchant who had established a company Almy and Brown to develop frame or water spinning Brown responded on December to Slaters initial inquiry saying Almy and Brown certainly wanted the assistance of a person with Slaters skills because an experimental mill had failed no persons being acquainted with the business and the frames imperfectOnce in Almy and Browns Pawtucket plant Slater found the existing machinery totally unsatisfactory He entered into a partnership with Almy and Brown to erect perpetual card and spinning machines otherwise known as the Arkwright patents By the firm of Almy Brown and Slater was operating a seventytwospindle mill producing highquality yarn From the Pawtucket mill the American cottonspinning industry was launchedThe Slater mill not only copied British technology but recreated that countrys arrangement of family labor which included young children sixday weeks the minimum twelvehour day Sabbath schools and payment of wages partly in goods and partly in cash The form of ownership and management also followed British linesone partner financed the venture while the other furnished the technical knowhow For these accomplishments Samuel Slater has been called the father of American manufactures His story underscores the international role of textiles and apparel their impetus in national economic development and their place in conflicts over domestic production and importsa theme that recurs throughout US history For example from the outset of the new nation President George Washington and his Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton wanted to encourage USbased industry Indeed Washington wore a dark brown suit entirely made in America for his first inaugural on April In this chapter we will concentrate on the past hundred years outlining major changes in American retail apparel and textiles that occurred before the s The industrial transformation of this earlier period which affected far more than these three industries echoes todays enormous shifts in supplier relations manufacturing operations and human resource practices The changes now going on have their analog in the last century when technological innovations of the day like railroads telegraph and steam powerdeveloped for purposes far afield of retail apparel or textileshelped transform the mass distribution of goods and informationAlfred Chandler described the last industrial transformation in his wellknown book The Visible Hand The use of everything from railroads to an improved postal service according to Chandler created enterprises with internal administrative structures that coordinated the flow of goods from many individual producers to many more consumers This administrative coordination reduced the number of transactions involved in the flow of goods increased the speed and regularity of that flow and so lowered costs and improved the productivity of the American distribution systemThe parallels with the information integration now occurring in retailappareltextile channelsthis time driven by advances in computer and related technologiesare striking In fact another industrial transformation is under way one that rivals the earlier revolution in organizational structure and management The first three sections of this chapter summarize the emergence of the US retail apparel and textile industries over the past century including a number of human resource issues The fourth section looks at their channel relations prior to the mids before some enterprises started interacting with each other in new ways This brief historical survey highlights not only the crucial developments that still undergird these industries but also the systems and work practices from an earlier era that no longer match todays competitive requirementsRetail From General Stores to Mass RetailersIn urban centers there have always been small shops with goods for sale Often the owners of these shops produced the goods themselves such as the cobblers and silversmiths of old At farmers markets families would display the vegetables they grew or sell eggs from their chickens At most a town might have a general store with a motley array of dry goods based on a limited distribution systemone that relied on local producers and faraway supply houses with extremely long lead times and spotty delivery The old system didnt begin to shift until the midnineteenth century with the advent of a new kind of middleman Alfred Chandler writesIn the s and the s the modern commodity dealer who purchased directly from the farmer and sold directly to the processor took over the distribution of agricultural products In the same years the fullline fullservice wholesaler began to market consumer goods Then in the s and s the modern mass retailerthe department store the mail order house and the chain storestarted to make inroads on the wholesalers marketsUntil the emergence of mass retail the wholesalerjobber dominated the distribution of consumer dry goods to general stores clothing upholstered furnishings hardware drugs tobacco furniture china and glassware Unlike traveling peddlers of the past who carried everything with them these salesmen could ride the rails into town with no more than a trunk of samples and catalogs The new infrastructure created by the railroads and telegraph contributed to the growth of wholesale houses Retailers no longer needed to carry such large inventories the risk of losing shipments was reduced and delivery was more certain on a specified schedule Increased volume cut unit costs and enhanced cash flow reducing credit needs Moreover these salesmen provided a flow of information to their headquarters on changing demand in various localities as well as the credit ratings of local storekeepers and merchantsWholesalerjobber enterprises of the time such as Field Leiter and Company in Chicago which later became Marshall Field and Company required both a purchasing organization and an extensive traveling sales force to sell to the scattered general stores in smaller cities and country towns These buyers and their assistants each handled a major product line like hardware or dry goods They typically determined the specifications of the goods purchased the volume purchased and the price to be charged to customers at retail These buyers became the most important managers in wholesalerjobber companies foreshadowing the key status of the buyer in later retail organizationsThe wholesalerjobber distribution system peaked in the early s It was subsequently supplanted by mass retailers in the form of department stores in large urban cities and by mailorder houses focused on smaller communities and rural markets As Chandler recountsMass retailers displaced wholesalejobbers as soon as they were able to exploit a market as large as that covered by the wholesalers By building comparable purchasing organizations they could buy directly from manufacturers and develop a higher stockturn than the jobbers Their administrative networks were more effective because they were in direct contact with the customers and because they eliminated one major set of middlemenOther factors drove the development of mass retail as well The rapid growth of urban cities and access to their downtown areas initially with horsedrawn streetcars encouraged mass retailers Department stores with a wide range of goods arranged in departments provided onestop shopping both novel and appealing to consumers of the period The increase in women seeking readymade clothing and home furnishings also contributed to the rise of the department store as did newspaper advertising Although small specialty shops were limited to a few items such as those found in a traditional dressmaker or milliners shop department stores offered fixed prices and the convenience of returning purchases for exchange or cash They sold goods at a lower markup than specialty stores and above all concentrated on achieving a high level of stockturn or the number of times products turn over in a given yearMany of the first department stores have names that are still familiar Macys in New York Marshall Fields in Chicago John Wanamaker in Philadelphia Chandler points out that the stores founded in the s and s accounted for almost half of the leading department stores in New York a century later In addition he writes Because sales were made on the stores premises rather than through traveling salesmen buyers had an even larger role than they did in the wholesale houses They had direct charge of the sales personnel who marketed their lines over the counterThen there was the parallel growth of mailorder sales With the help of new transportation and communications systems the first company to market a wide variety of consumer goods exclusively by mail and parcel post was Montgomery Ward formed in The Grange the largest organization of farmers supported the company By its catalog of pages listed items But Sears Roebuck and Co outstripped Montgomery Ward in the s As with the wholesalerjobber and the emerging department stores the buyers at Sears had full autonomy Chandler notes Each merchandise department was a separate dynasty and the buyer was in complete chargeDepartment stores and mailorder houses and later chain stores in food distribution dominated mass retailing after through large volume high inventory turnover lower prices payments in cash that reduced the need for credit and debt and the crucial role of the buyer Although wholesalerjobbers had faded from the scene the policies practices and administrative organizations of many mass distributors were derived from them Other buying practices came from small shops Each retail merchandise department particularly in multistore organizations became a separate fiefdom with the buyer in charge of product selection scale timing of orders and pricing Up until the mids the buyers personal network of contacts and feel for what customers wanted determined marketing policy And although the wages of nonsupervisory workers in retail have been and still are quite low the compensation system for buyers provided substantial rewards for favorable resultsConsequently for decades the decisions of buyers in retail organizations directly affected apparel and textile suppliers The distribution system that emerged after would not be challenged until more than a century later Only in the s with the development of another system of mass distribution that includes new technology new management methods and new links to manufacturinglean retailingdid the role of the buyer significantly diminishApparel From Home Work to Modern ManufactureIn colonial days housewives typically did spinning weaving and tailoring for the family The welltodo purchased imported cloth and had apparel made by itinerant tailors or those in small shops The readymade garment industry grew out of altered rejects and secondhand clothing that were then sold to the poorer classes in the cities In a percent import duty curtailed clothing primarily from England and increased the demand for American home industry By the US Census reports that there were establishments with workers percent of them womenin the readymade clothing industry Cloth was cut and assembled into bundles in these establishments given out to workers to take home to sew and returned for finishing operationsWith the invention of the sewing machine by Howe and its perfection by Singer in a new era began in the manufacture of clothing when more work became concentrated in shops The Civil War and the consequent need for uniforms stimulated the factory system and the introduction of standard bodysize measurements facilitated readytowear clothing When Hart Schaffner and Marx for instance opened its doors in only percent of mens suits were readymade By most men wore suits that came from a factory In this period a number of key technological changes appeared sewing machines that made many more stitches a minute long knives instead of shears for cutting and pressing machinesFrom the nineteenth century on enterprises in the apparel industry have taken one of three general forms the manufacturer with an inside shop the jobber and the contractor with an outside shop which can supply either manufacturers or jobbers The jobber a form characteristic of womens apparel does not produce in a plant that it owns Jobbers may purchase cloth and materials design or purchase design of garments and cut or contract out cutting of fabrics They turn over sewing and assembly to contractors and their main role is to merchandise finished productThe jobbercontractor system developed to address many of the issues that still concern apparelmakers It provided great flexibility in coping with fluctuations in style season and economic conditions at the same time jobbers did not take on the substantial costs of plant equipment or employees that inside shop manufacturers did This system also separated and specialized the functions of production from the purchase of materials and the selling of finished productsdevelopments that greatly influence womens and childrens apparel today including the complexity of the regulation of labor conditionsRegardless apparel operations in both the mens and womens segments have always been labor intensive even with continual technological innovation the work still comes down to cutting cloth and sewing pieces together into a garment Although union organization has not been so extensive in retail or textiles unions have been important players in apparel manufacturing At the same time apparel manufacturers have pressed for ever greater productivity on the shop floor hoping to cut labor costs in a variety of ways These two related historical issuesthe ascendancy of a particular system of clothing assembly and the role of unionshave a direct bearing on what is now happening in retailappareltextile channelsDevelopment of the Progressive Bundle SystemFor the most part inplant production methods for apparel have been organized around the way in which cut parts of garments are distributed to operators for sewing and then assembled into the completed garment From the outset of the factory system in woven apparel after cloth has been laid out and cut in the configurations of patterns for various sizes the cut parts have been grouped by parts of the garmentfronts backs sleeves patches for pockets collarsand tied together into bundles for operators who sew together individual partshence the term bundle system Each worker specializes in one or at most a few sewing operationsBy the early s two systems of sewing and assembly emerged in the mens segment of the apparel industry the progressive bundle system PBS and the straightline system SLS The ascendancy of PBS in the mens industry where it remains by far the dominant system even today illustrates how product market competitionspecifically intense pricebased competitiongave rise to distinctive human resource practicesPBS refined the traditional bundle system by organizing individual sewing tasks in a systematic fashion It entails better engineering of specific sewing tasks including some specialized sewing machines to reduce the amount of time required for each task A worker receives a bundle of unfinished garments She performs a single operation on each garment in the bundle The completed bundle is then placed in a buffer with other bundles that have been completed to that point Machines are laid out in a manner that speeds up shuttling a bin of garment bundles from operator to operator With its roots in Taylorism each PBS task is given a target time or SAM Standard Allocated Minutes Timestudy engineers calculate the SAM for an entire garment for an experienced worker as the sum of the number of minutes required for each operation in the production process including allowances for worker fatigue rest periods personal time and so onThe straightline system SLS also attempted to apply Tayloristic notions to apparel but in a way that had more in common with scientific management techniques used in other manufacturing industries SLS breaks down tasks into simple sewing operations just as PBS does Unlike PBS however SLS uses the single garment rather than the bundle as the unit of production As a result SLS operates essentially without bundles or extensive buffers operators pass garments directly to the next worker thus allowing for single or a few apparel items to move through the assembly process rapidlyIn its limited adoptions in the s the SLS sewing room was organized in short rows of sewing machines based on the sequence of operations for the garment Even more than under PBS sewing tasks were broken down in minute detail both as a means of increasing speed and decreasing skill requirements Engineers designed operations to take similar lengths of time to achieve line balancing When a specific task took longer than the surrounding operations multiple workers were employed on the slower task to achieve balance Each operators workstation was connected by a bar or chute that fed the garment directly to the next workerYet linebalancing problems bedeviled SLS operations Laying out a production line required exact calculation of the number of workers required for a given step to keep single garments moving through the operation continuouslymuch as a car moves down an assembly line The lack of buffers for bundles made the system vulnerable to daytoday fluctuations in the performance of individual operators whether because of fatigue health mood absenteeism substitutions or intentional slowdowns In a competitive market that placed a premium on pricecost competition and little value on time to market the small reduction in direct labor cost did not justify the high potential costs and risks that arose from SLS downtime In contrast PBS provided apparel manufacturers with a means for improving labor productivity along with adaptability to daytoday variations in shopfloor conditionsIn virtually all assembly in the mens shirt industry for example was done on the basis of bundle systems of production By percent of production workers were classified as operating under the traditional bundle system percent assembled shirts through PBS and less than percent used the line system By the percentage using traditional bundles had fallen to percent PBS had risen to percent of all production workers and line systems remained uncommon at percent By PBS had become virtually the only assembly system used in mens and boys shirt production with less than percent of production accounted for by SLS and others systemsThe dominance of PBS affects current developments in apparel manufacturing and employee management for two reasons First the system depends on buffers between assembly operations to minimize downtime Standard practice is a oneday buffer between operations With a pair of pants assembled through roughly forty operations a large amount of inprocess inventory is created More important a given pair of pants takes about forty days to move from cut pieces to final product Now that apparel manufacturers face more stringent orderfulfillment requirements and are expected to provide a much wider range of products to retailers the costs of large amounts of inprocess inventory have grown tremendouslySecond PBS is not set up for largescale modifications of assembly Although this system has never had as many problems with line balancing as SLS creating sufficient buffers between assembly steps to keep everyone in the sewing room occupied remains a challenge Under PBS a balanced line is a function of the workers rate of speed at each of the steps the total volume moving through the system the current incentive rates and such daily uncertainties as turnover and absenteeism Because introducing changes at any step may unbalance the system as a whole technological innovations have not easily found their way into the sewing roomwhich may be out of sync with what an integrated retailappareltextile channel requiresThe Role of Labor OrganizationsApparel workplaces have historically been located in major metropolitan areasNew York Chicago Philadelphia Rochester Baltimore Cleveland St Louisand drawn on successive waves of immigrants In the production of both mens and womens clothing immigrant labor provided a continuing secure labor force that often already had the requisite skills In three out of five workers were foreign born and a large percentage of the nativeborn were of foreign parentage The union in the mens clothing field at the time issued official publications in eight different languages Practically all the manufacturers were firstgeneration Jewish immigrants More recently apparel manufacturers seeking lower labor costs have moved to the American South and California But a disproportionate number of domestic apparel workers are still immigrantsGiven access to a large pool of immigrant labor in urban centers the jobbercontractor system in womens apparel led to the widescale presence and abuses of sweatshops Sweatshops at the turn of the century encompassed a range of workplaces in which as one commentator noted Congestion unsanitary quarters lack of restriction on child labor absolutely unregulated hours and miserable pay combine to create a condition which endangers the lives not only of the workers but of the purchasers of their products A study in of the sweating system estimated that onehalf of the clothing manufactured at that time came from factories while the other half originated in home work or was subcontracted in small shops often adjoining homesOrganizing a relatively lowskill immigrant workforce presented great challenges to unions in the garment industry Employer resistance to unionization arising from the highly competitive conditions in apparel markets and the significant percentage of total costs arising from labor further compounded the problem This difficult environment shaped the organizing and representation strategies of the two major unionsthe Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America and the International Ladies Garment Workers Union ILGWUas well as their relations with employers through collective bargaining arrangements Both unions established a foothold in the industry because they represented strategic workers in the apparel production process the skilled cutter working inside manufacturers plants Cutters required substantial training and the withdrawal of their labor could quickly shut down all sewing and pressing operations Because cutters worked on multiple layers of fabric at one time their errors were likely to be costly Not surprisingly cutters were the highest paid workers receiving day ratesBy organizing cutters first unions gained the leverage with which they could then organize and represent the much larger but less skilled group of sewers who worked in factory settings particularly in the mens industry or in the small shops that characterized the womens industry The principal architects of this approach Sidney Hillman founding president of the Amalgamated and David Dubinsky longtime president of the ILGWU were cutters and came out of this craftgroupGiven this union foothold collective bargaining in apparel focused on the standardization of labor in a market area and a product line This was done because of the organization of work in clothing shops the low capital costs and high proportion of labor costs especially in womens wear for contract shops the intense product competition among manufacturers within and among geographic markets and the diversity of products and changing styles The unions drew on several different methods to standardize wages and conditions within the markets For the ILGWU standardizing wages required regulation through collective bargaining of the network of contractors and submanufacturers working for jobbers and manufacturers Emphasizing the potential role of the union in this regard ILGWU President Dubinsky commented on the difficult conditions of the sThe employers in the stable shops with employees whom they were anxious to keep suffered as much as we did because the union was weak They had to pay decent wages and maintain decent conditions but they also had to compete with the flybynights and chiselers They began to recognize that the union was a necessary stabilizing force They could not meet conditions if their competitors were free to ignore themEmployers who signed the major collective bargaining agreements with the ILGWU in the womens industry primarily manufacturers not only agreed to abide by wage and working conditions for their own employees they also pledged to use only contractors designated or registered with the union and the employer association These contractors in turn agreed to abide by the terms laid out by the collective agreement The collective bargaining process aimed to control contractors by making the manufacturer responsible in the areaproduct agreement for its suppliers behavior and payment of wages and benefitsBoth unions also sought to standardize wages by setting piece rates for assembly work At the shop level this was expressed in union involvement in piecerate setting through union experts At the manufacturers level collective bargaining sought to standardize direct wage and benefit costs for product lines such as womens coats suits dresses and intimate apparel through various joint boards To support these activities the apparel labor unions created in their national offices industrial engineering departments to seek improvement in work practices and experiences The unions and their employers also became pioneers in establishing neutral umpires and arbitrators in the handling of labormanagement disputesOver time major growth in imports and traditional pricecost competition have reduced the strategic leverage of the apparel unions and their chosen methods of wage stabilization The Amalgamated and ILGWU merged in to form the Union of Needletrades Industrial and Textile Employeesor UNITE On a laborcost basis alone US workers cannot compete with foreign apparel assembly operations in developing countries At the same time the problem of sweatshops persists despite government regulation of minimum wages overtime child labor and safety issues In fact regulation has increased significantly since the s and Secretaries of Labor continue to be concerned about sweatshops and violations of labor standards in apparelTextiles From Fiber to Cloth to Finished ProductThe basic processes of the textile industrythe spinning of fibers and the weaving of clothgo back to ancient times The early phases of the Industrial Revolution in England were closely linked to the mechanization of the textile industry and its transfer from the home to the factory Textiles have also led the industrialization process in many recently developing countriesFor the United States this brings us back to Samuel Slater father of American manufactures By the Pawtucket Rhode Island enterprise begun with Slaters cunning had spawned a vibrant cottonspinning industry throughout New England The next step in developing a USbased industry was to bring the machine that took yarn and transformed it into finished cloththe power loomacross the Atlantic This feat was accomplished in much the same way that Slater brought cotton spinning to the United States through the agency of a crafty Boston merchant Francis Cabot Lowell As business historian Robert Dalzell notesThe crowning glory of Britains textile technology remained beyond the reach of American manufacturers Until that is Lowell scored his triumph Leaving the British official who twice searched his luggage none the wiser he managed by meticulous observation to memorize the principal features of the power loom well enough to produce his own version of it on his return to BostonA fullblown textile industry therefore blossomed in New England fostered by the regions access to abundant water power capital mechanical skills and a hardworking labor force But the adoption of steam power in New England was delayed until the s and s at which time most of the significant waterpower sites were already in use The efficiency of steam engines had by then been greatly improved through the use of better materials and their operating costs reduced by cheaper transportation of coal Southern manufacturers had already adopted steam engines for textile production along with newer and more productive technology As a result after the industry began to expand south particularly in North and South Carolina Georgia and Alabama By over half of the spinning and weaving capacity was in the South leading industrialization there By little of this basic part of the textile industry remained in New EnglandThe US textile industry has taken advantage of economies of scale in production to serve large expanding and for much of the century protected markets for textile products It has become an industry adept at producing highquality products in large runs competitively and its strengths and limitations must be understood in this contextCapital Intensity and Economies of ScalePrimary textile manufacturing includes both the spinning of raw cotton and other fibers into yarn and the weaving of yarn into greige goods or unfinished cloth Although there have been specialized spinning and weaving mills the great majority of output is produced in enterprises that engage in both operations In fact Lowell and his associates established the first incorporated manufacturing operation when they set up an integrated mill from cotton to finished fabric The cloth produced in weaving mills requires further finishingsuch as bleaching shrinking dyeing and printingbefore it is ready for sale to the apparel industry to retail distributors or to industrial consumers To undertake such a comprehensive set of activities of course requires significant capital investment From the outset of the Industrial Revolution spinning weaving and finishing have called for substantial investments in plants power and equipmentBecause of this capital intensity the textile industry has been driven by economies of scale American plants have largely succeeded through making huge runs of a limited range of products and since the s technological changes on the floormuch quieter machinery for example or removal of the ubiquitous cotton dust now required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration that used to affect both worker performance and the quality of clothhave dramatically improved industry performance Further the knitting machine has been a key development in manufacturing technology Knitted goods are an essential and growing segment of the textile industry a trend that reflects the increasing demand for casual wear The knitting machine produces cloth as the loom does but uses a different method The warp knitting machine produces a flat fabric much like woven cloth while the circular knitting machine creates a tubular fabric The most important knit goods products are hosiery knit underwear and knit outerwearpopular casual wear items like Tshirts polo shirts and sweatpants Knitting mills now account for almost percent of production employees engaged in textile manufacturingContinuing integration of the industry also contributed to the rise in productivity Although small familyowned and operated companies were the norm in traditional textiles in the early s leaders like Burlington Industries and Milliken undertook vertical integration to handle textile products from fiber to finishing Historically finishing operations were often undertaken by separate firms known as converters which played a large role in the design of finished goods Companies like Burlington integrated forward by bringing converting operations inhouse while a number of converters extended their operations backward into primary textilesBeyond restructuring for materials flow the industry has experienced substantial horizontal integration As a consequence some segments of textiles such as spinning weaving and knitting became more concentrated by the late s The industry underwent another substantial restructuring in the s and product lines became even more concentrated Much of this happened because less efficient firms using older technologies went under or were absorbed by larger survivors Between and the number of textile establishments declined by percent from to and industry employment fell by nearly percent At present the four largest firms control about percent of weaving and yarn mills output although many finishing and dyeing companies and knitting firms remain smallHuman Resources and Productivity GrowthThe drive to gain advantage from economies of scale and the role of manufacturing technology in textiles have also affected the people who work in the industry Ever since garmentmaking entered the factory system the textile industry has been much more capital intensive than apparel Today we estimate capital per worker in apparel at while the figure for basic textile operations is several hundred thousand dollars As a result human resource practices in the two industries differ considerablyFor one thing the textile industrys machine operations involve a large number of distinct job classifications defined by the technology and production process they fall within a narrow range of compensation with the classifications of loom fixers weavers maintenance electricians and machinists above that range Because the textile industry has become so capital intensive there are fewer jobs than in the pastbut the people who remain are on average paid more than apparel workers some lowerskill jobs such as the picker tender opening bales of fiber have now been automated out of existence In average hourly earnings in textiles were an hour compared with in apparel By textile hourly earnings had risen to compared with in apparel in textile workers earned an average of an hour percent more than the an hour of those in apparel Currently only percent of textile employees are women while women constitute percent of apparel workersLabor organizations have historically had a small proportion of the textile industry under collective agreements As the textile industry moved south to the Piedmont states it drew on a rural and small community workforce largely made up of native whites Textile mills at their outset often provided the principal employment in the locality The first unions were formed among some of the skilled craftspeople such as loom fixers weavers spinners and slasher tenders particularly in New England With the advent of the CIO industrial unionism sought to organize more workers in the industry and the Textile Workers Union of America merged with the established Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union in However organization met fierce opposition from southern textile employers Currently about percent of the textile production and nonsupervisory workforce is organized compared with percent in the apparel industryThe combined impact of these factors is captured by the following trends From to US production of textiles increased almost threefold Over the same time period the number of production workers decreased by almost half And the rate of textile productivity over this period far outpaced that for the manufacturing sector as a whole We discuss the performance of the textile industry extensively in Chapter Although US apparel firms struggled in the s competing with foreign producers on labor costs the domestic textile industry fared much better Successful exploitation of economies of scale favorable international trade agreements such as the MFA and special arrangements for apparel imports made of US textileseven the clout of certain southern senators looking after the firms in their statesmean the US textile story has not been determined by import penetrationEven so lean retailing practices pose both new opportunities and challenges for the textile industry Supplier relations in retailappareltextile channels are shifting Textile manufacturers no longer simply supply apparelmakers with cloth they may also sell a variety of household goods such as sheets and towels directly to retailers or serve industrial users with a wide range of products Because product proliferation is the order of the day in all these markets textile firms are being asked by their customers to provide many more products in smaller lot sizes and with shorter lead times In the new competitive arenawhere demand uncertainty and time to market have become important factors along with pricetextile firms are being forced to adapt to informationintegrated channels rather than just drawing on the economies of scale that led to their success in the pastHistorical Relations Among Retail Apparel and Textile FirmsFor most of the last century companies in one of these industries related to those in another through markets as sellers and buyers The business enterprises that emerged in the American retail apparel and textile industries were for the most part separated They weathered diverse competitive conditions they differed markedly in their capital structures costs of entry and exit size and scale of operations the proportion of direct labor costs unionization geographic locations and so on There was almost no vertical integration across retail apparel and textiles For example only a few major manufacturers in mens apparel have also entered into the retail businessBond Stores in the World War II era Hart Schaffner and Marx more recentlyalthough Levi Strauss a manufacturer of jeans has opened some retail operations As for retailers most mass distributors have focused on buying and selling rather than manufacturing productsNo textile producer of woven goods has been a significant apparel manufacturer One company Burlington Industries sells directly to organizations that purchase uniforms for airlines police and fire personnel It specifies in the sale that regardless of the apparel firm used to fabricate uniforms Burlingtons cloth must be used Another major textile company Milliken has a degree of common ownership with a retail business Mercantile although these arrangements remain unusualTextile firms however have been players in multiple supply channels There are three major categories of sales outlets for these manufacturers woven goods and some knit goods destined for clothing in which materials are sold to apparelmakers for fabrication and assembly home furnishingssuch as sheets bedspreads towels and some knit goodsin which the textile firm sells directly to retailers industrial products from automobile seat covers and rugs to commercial fishing nets in which a textile firm sells materials to a car company or other nonapparel manufacturer Thus there are at least three kinds of relations among the industries and multiple textile channels are on the rise Although apparel uses dominated textile consumption in the past by the early s apparels share of fiber consumption was only percent home furnishings was about percent and industrial textile products consumed over percentTextile companies like Springs have taken advantage of these new outletsfor example producing Disneycharacter sheets for retailbut a new dynamic is also developing with apparelmakers who want shorter runs of materials much more quickly from their textile suppliers Historically the textileapparel relationship involved long lead times or advance commitments to secure the necessary cloth in the right style texture and patterns This occurred not only because of the greater concentration of businesses in the textile industry but because textile companies generally plan to run their expensive capital equipment at full capacity around the clock Our research indicates that the relationships between firms in the textile and apparel industries remain underdeveloped with new competitive forces driving both sides to changeEven if integration efforts in the past have been uncommon information flows transport and inventory have always been decisive factors in shaping the relations among retail apparel and textile firms As Alfred Chandler and other business historians have made clear successive changes in information exchange and transport over the last century have reshaped relations among industries as well as the internal organization of these enterprises Chandler notesSignificantly it was in several of these laborintensive more fragmented industriestextiles apparel furniture and some food processingthat the mass retailer the department stores mailorder houses and chain stores began to coordinate the flow of goods from manufacturer to consumer In those industries where substantial economies of scale and scope did not exist in production highvolume flows through the processes of production and distribution came to be guidedand the resulting cost reductions achievedby the buying departments of mass retailers retailers who handled a variety of related products through their facilitiesAnd so we arrive at the new information technologies of the s These have begun to create integrated channels among enterprises in the three industries facilitating even more product proliferation and stimulating changes in merchandising inventory management internal production practices and methods of using human resources When it comes to the driving force behind the late twentiethcentury industrial transformation lean retailing is at the forefront of that revolution In John Wanamaker opened his flagship store in downtown Philadelphia The twelvestory building with its fortyfive acres of floor space was the largest of its time devoted to retail merchandising Its central Grand Court had marble arches that rose feet and was capped by a dome Major physical innovations were hidden behind this visual wonder sixtyeight stateoftheart elevators the latest in fireproofing a large power plant devoted entirely to the store and sophisticated heating ventilating and sanitation systemsWanamaker had been in the forefront of retailing for more than thirty years by the time he opened this store His goal was to provide the elegant shopping experience of major European boutiques while satisfying the American desire for product diversity At the same time he based his retailing system on four fundamental principles one price for a product no haggling prices guaranteed to be percent lower than the lowest elsewhere acceptance of cash payments only in order to keep prices low and cash refunds or exchanges for unsatisfied customers With these fundamental principles in hand he became one of the leading retailers of his daySixty years after the opening of Wanamakers Philadelphia store another entrepreneur synthesized a set of existing technologies and along with a number of other retailers began another revolution in the industry Sam Walton started small in the s but WalMart rapidly became the largest retailer in the United States with total sales in fiscal year equaling the combined sales volumes of Kmart Sears Roebuck and Co and the supermarket chain The Kroger Co the next three largest American retail organizations Waltons successful innovations placed enormous pressure on other mass merchant retailers to alter their practices along similar lines By the late s a growing number of retailers had started changing the way they did businessAs we have emphasized the current retail revolutioninvolving new information technologies new product labeling and new methods of distributionhas driven changes in the apparel and textile industries as well Yet this revolution didnt happen overnight nor was it the brainchild of a single entrepreneur In fact the retail systems of both Wanamaker and Walton integrated a variety of innovations that had already been pioneered by other retailers For example Wanamakers oneprice policy was initially adopted by wholesaler Arthur Tappan in the s and experimented with by Lord Taylor in and Rowland Macy in the early s Similarly bar codes and electronic scanningkey building blocks of new retailing practicesbegan in the grocery industry Kmart became the first major nonfood retailer to employ them as a means of tracking inventory in the early s several years before Walton made this technology a core building block of his distribution systemThis chapter will examine the differences between the traditional retail model and lean retailing We explore how the set of practices that traditional retailers drew on to merchandise and distribute products became increasingly costly Then we return to why retailersWalMart Kmart J C Penney Dillards Inc Federated Department Stores and othersadapted technologies and management practices to handle demand uncertainty product proliferation and complex sourcing decisionsThe Retail ChallengeImagine the problems faced by a typical department store It must cater to a diverse clientele men women and children with varied tastes disparate income levels and a wide range of physical measurements It must deal with seasonal changes that affect the type of clothes offeredis it winter or summer The beginning of the school year The holiday season If the company operates stores in different geographic regions its product offerings must also reflect regional differences in style weather income and culture In addition to these factors consumer tastes often shift rapidly sometimes within a single season These longstanding causes of variation in consumer demand have been further compounded by accelerating product proliferation in all segments of the apparel industryThe combination of different sizes colors styles fabrics price lines and consumer groups means that a retailer must carry an enormous range of different products The more diverse the consumer base of the retailer the larger the number of individual products typically measured in stockkeeping units SKUs This variety is portrayed in Table which shows the number of SKUs provided annually by different types of retailers over the course of a year The number of SKUs can range from just for a discount food store like Costco which offers a limited number of products sold in large quantities to more than two million different items in an upscale department storeToday retailers must manage this profusion of products At an operational level this means deciding what types and how many of any one good it should stock to maximize sales per square foot of available spaceone of the most critical measures of retail performance If all goes well retailers allocate space to different goods efficiently responding to shifts in consumer tastes stocking the hits and discontinuing flops setting pricing policies markups and markdowns to deal with both the direct cost of goods and the nature of consumer demand and controlling inventory to reduce exposure to risk Further the contemporary retailer has to keep track of sales and inventory accurately by SKUThe Elements of Traditional RetailingThe early twentiethcentury success of Wanamakers and other department stores illustrates that the keys to effective retailing are providing customers with a variety of desirable products procuring those products at a low enough cost to make a profit marketing them well and charging prices that reflect customers willingness to pay As we discussed in the last chapter large retailers were able to implement this strategy in the late nineteenth century because the falling distribution costs afforded by a national railway system as well as new information links arising from the telegraph and later the telephone provided economies of scale and scope Other technological innovations including steel construction plate glass and the Otis elevator allowed retailers to expand multistory floor space without purchasing more real estate providing for a more varied collection of products The creation of a national highway system in the s further fostered the development of mass retailing by opening vast new spaces in suburban mallsUnder the traditional model retailers ordered desired products far in advance of the selling season because their apparel suppliers charged less for large runs and long lead times with long periods of advance commitment Retail buyers assigned to a specific product line purchased products based on their best guesses of what would sell They would then apply rules of thumb to allocate volume across styles and sizes These transactions typically occurred eight to ten months before the goods appeared on the retailers selling floor The success of buyers therefore turned on their ability to predict what consumers would want and to obtain those products at the lowest possible cost Although the order would specify a delivery time far closer to the season once the buyer placed the order with the apparel manufacturer it typically remained unchanged until delivery to the retailers warehouse or individual storesAs portrayed in Figure the typical shipment between an apparel manufacturer and retail customers was large and of low frequencyusually once a season Once delivered the retailer held the products in central warehouses or as inventory in individual stores back rooms When the desired time of display and sale arrived workers stocked the product on the selling floor and replenished from store or warehouse inventories as the selling period progressed Inventory control relied on painstaking manual comparisons between sales records paper receipts and physical counts of items on the floor in the back room and in warehouses Overstocks at the close of a season were then marked down for clearance warehoused in inventory for future sales or sold to a secondary market supplying discount retailersThose who could predict or in some cases create markets for new products clearly were at an advantage Not surprisingly fast tracks in the traditional retail world started with buyers and many apparel CEOs successfully demonstrated their feel for the market early in their careers This list includes John Wanamaker and Marshall Field in the early era of the department store Stanley Marcus of Nieman Marcus and Millard S Drexler of The Gap are more recent examples of buyer CEOsThe best traditional retailers were also good at merchandising Effective merchandising requires matching the retailers product mix to the tastes and incomes of its targeted customers Establishing the target customer base is therefore a critical first step in any merchandising strategy Although this may seem obvious today Wanamaker shook up the existing retail world in the s by seeking to understand his customers preferences as a basis for making merchandising choicesA century later retailing success is often attributed to combining effective marketing with an understanding of consumer tastes The growth of privatelabel programs among retailers in the s exemplifies this trend In privatelabel programs retailers create a distinctive product line under their exclusive name and license If successful a retailers privatelabel program can capitalize on the same type of strong brand recognition that has yielded profits to companies like Levi Strauss or more recently Tommy Hilfiger For example the success of The Gaps jeans J C Penneys Arizona line and Searss Canyon River Blue line has led to erosion of the market share held by the two leading jeans manufacturers Levi Strauss and VF Corporation According to Standard Poors In the s the standout performers in retailing developed a sustainable competitive advantage by differentiating themselves in the eyes of the consumerThe winners have either created new markets or revitalized old businesses with a price and product mix geared toward a narrower marketIn addition to effective buyers and merchandising successful traditional retailers relied on a third element purchasing products at low costs through buying power volume or cash position or via access to the cheapest domestic and international sources for apparel As weve already noted international sourcing has become increasingly prevalent Beginning in the s retailers expanded their offshore sourcing efforts especially after quality standards improved establishing sourcing offices and relationships in lowwage countries particularly in AsiaThe Growing Costs of Traditional RetailingNevertheless largescale retailing came with its own risks Through their buying power traditional retailers could dramatically lower the direct costs of procurement and in the process usurp the role of wholesalers in the apparel distribution system Purchasing in large quantities for their stores however subjected retailers to the attendant risk of selling perishable products like apparel The absence of business systems capable of adjusting to realtime demand information as well as the lack of information between the time when orders were placed and the actual selling season meant that early order commitments could not be amended pending new information In terms of the retail bottom line this risk appeared in the indirect costs associated with holding inventories of unwanted products and stockouts of popular itemsTwo trends over the past twentyfive years have compounded the problems inherent in the traditional retail model First product proliferation has vastly increased the number of products retailers are required to manage in their stores Second the total amount of retail space in the United States has expanded dramatically even while consumer expenditures on apparel items have declined as a share of total expenditures Some analysts deem this the overstoring of America Since the early s retailers have faced the growing costs associated with holding inventories of a wider variety of goods in a world increasingly characterized by industry overcapacity Lowcost international suppliers helped fill the gap for a while but the traditional retail model can no longer hold its own without information integration and other innovationsProduct ProliferationIn Chapter we introduced the fashion triangle which includes the three types of goods commonly sold by apparel retailers fashion fashionbasic and basic products Although product variety in apparel has historically been associated with the fashion end of the industry the number of products available to US consumers in almost every apparel category has grown significantly over the past two decadesConsider mens shirts Throughout much of the postWorld War II era the majority of mens shirts sold in the United States were white dress shirts But today a shirt manufacturers basic collection typically includes solid white blue and a whiteblue weave as well as white with color stripes in pure cotton cottonpolyester blends of various mixtures and other fabrics like percent cotton oxford pinpoint oxford and several qualities of broadcloth Most of the collection will come with a choice of collar styles and some will include a French cuff option There are also common cuts silhouettes such as regular athletic loose fit and long In addition to these dimensions there are quarterly collections of different fabrics Each shirt corresponding to a combination of these characteristicsfor example a blue buttondown pinpoint oxford shirt with French cuffs cut longhas its own pattern of demand that varies considerably over the course of a yearFor a retailer a larger number of SKUs raises the level of uncertainty regarding what product will sell or not sell in any period In practical terms this means that a retailer carrying a broader array of goods faces increased costs both for carrying goods in inventory that will not sell overstocks and running out of a good that sells beyond expectations stockouts The costs associated with demand uncertainty which were previously connected primarily with fashion productsthat is the problem of selling a highly perishable itemhave grown enormously for apparel retailers Apparel retailers are not alone The variety of products offered has increased considerably in most consumer product sectors from most segments of the retail food industry to home building products to personal computersIncreasing product proliferation was clear among the business units in our survey as vividly portrayed in Figure The average number of SKUs per business unit rose from an average of in to in This overall increase is mirrored by growth in the average number of new SKUs introduced per year by apparel business units which increased from in to in Meanwhile the number of discontinued SKUs rose from to This means that a large portion of each apparel firms product line consists of new products The consequent churning of products adds further uncertainty to the retailers or manufacturers already difficult tasksRetail OvercapacityConstruction of retail centers particularly shopping malls boomed in the s Rapid expansion of retail space arose from a simple formula that had traditionally proven successful Add more stores and revenue growth will follow The early age of retailing was marked by the expansion of stores within major metropolitan areas but in the early s retailers started flocking to large enclosed suburban malls and nonenclosed strip malls As a result between and the annual rate of new shoppingcenter construction outpaced the growth in population and potential consumers The size of retail establishments also grew during this period because of two important trends First the number of independent department storesusually a singlesite enterprise of relatively moderate sizedeclined dramatically in the s Second many multienterprise retailers either built large new stores or expanded the size of existing onesFar outpacing the overall growth in population retail space per capita rose from square feet per person in to square feet in to square feet in By it had grown still further reaching close to square feet In comparison per capita retail space in a developing country like Mexico is estimated at square feetThe growth in consumer expenditures did not rise commensurately with the boom in retail space The apparel and upkeep share of household expenditures in the Consumer Price Index fell from percent in to percent in Per capita expenditure for apparel and related services declined from in to in in current dollars And these downward expenditure trends occurred in the face of growth in the average number of outerwear garments consumed per capita from garments in to garments in In other words the amount of money spent by an average consumer per garment fell over this period reflecting in part more casual workplaces which allow people to spend less on clothing for work and intense price competition Retailers with more and more floor space were chasing fewer and fewer apparelconsumption dollarsThe Retail FalloutIncreasing product proliferation retail overcapacity falling relative per capita expenditures on apparel and the constant pressure to provide lower prices to consumers created an unforgiving competitive environment for retailers Overall margins for the industry particularly for specific retail segments like department stores declined between and By the mids a number of the most prestigious retailers were faltering with some filing for bankruptcy or being acquired by other retailersDepartment stores proved to be one of the most adversely affected retail sectors Their inability to adapt to changing consumer tastes and the emergence of new retail channels that targeted specific consumer segmentsspecialty stores especially socalled category killers catalog stores and mass merchantsled to erosion in market share Although in the s and s the majority of apparel sales occurred in department stores by they accounted for only percent of all sales Venerable giants like Macys Gimbels Saks Fifth Avenue Federated and Wanamaker filed for bankruptcy in the late s and early sProduct proliferation coupled with industry overcapacity revealed the costs inherent in the traditional model of retailing Three types of costs were particularly high under the old model forced markdowns to clear out unsold goods lost sales from stockouts and the costs associated with holding inventory In the losses associated with markdowns stockouts and inventory carrying costs for US retailappareltextile channels were estimated to be billion An estimated percent of these losses billion arose from the need to mark down unsold products either through store sales and promotions or through the use of the sizable secondary market for items purchased by discount retailers for sale to other consumer segments Product stockouts accounted for percent billion of the losses and the cost of inventory carrying itself constituted the remaining percent billionPrice reductions from the beginning to the end of the season also increased dramatically over the period from to one in which there was considerable growth in product proliferation Consequently the difference between early season and endofseason prices for womens apparel from the late s to grew substantially Although these losses were borne throughout the entire channel to some extent a disproportionate share percent fell on retailers This is not surprising given the traditional retailing strategy under which retailers commit to purchases well in advance of the selling seasonDespite its high costs and negative impact on the bottom line being left with unwanted apparel productsor running out of fashion hitswas viewed by most traditional retailers as a cost of doing business With neither timely information on the state of sales at the store nor the capability to use that information little could be done to resolve this source of uncertainty and excess cost in the channel This historical constraint only began to change with the advent of the current retail revolutionThe Lean Retailing AlternativeThe whole point is speed and clarity of communications With this new technology buying procedures that used to take weeks have now been cut to daysand sometimes even hours That has greatly enhanced our response to new trends reduced turnaround times and increased the flexibility of all those involved in the buying processWilliam Howell Chairman JC Penney If lack of information provided a regrettable but unavoidable cost of doing business in retailing before the late s access to information has become crucial to competitive success in the s The ability to gather transmit and use information regarding sales at the cash register has created a new way of offering products to customers It has created the lean retailerThe leveraged buyouts mergers and corporate restructuring of the s left many of the historic retail powerhouses in a vulnerable condition with a number of the strongest traditional retailersMacys Saks Searsin an extremely weakened state But this industry landscape also left the field open for the emergence of a new kind of retail competitor one able to harness information as a central component of its competitive strategyA number of retailers filled this role becoming the vanguard of the lean retailing revolution Lean retailing represents an amalgam of technologies and management practices adopted and refined by various companies Although no single retailer pioneered or adopted all the innovations that compose lean retailing we focus here on those in three segmentsmass merchants national chains and departments storesthat played important roles in initiating the larger transformationMass Merchants WalMartWalMart is the most well known of the early lean retailers Traditional mass merchants sought cost advantage through economies of purchasing scale Given limited information on sales this meant that these retailers purchased large inventories of goods that they would then push to consumers often by means of price reductions and sales promotions Beginning in the late s WalMart sought to reduce its costs by using emerging information technologies to track consumer sales at the checkout counter monitor its inventory of goods within and across stores and then supply its stores on an ongoing basis via highly efficient centralized distribution methods By capitalizing on realtime information on sales and inventory position WalMart increased its ability to let consumer demand pull its orders As a result it could reduce the amount of inventory it needed to hold for any given product and focus its resources on stocking those goods that were being purchased by consumersThe WalMart strategy required and fostered the development of a companywide computer system to track incoming and outgoing shipments to the various stores Through the use of its own proprietary standard WalMart gathered and exchanged information among its stores distribution centers and the main office in Bentonville Arkansas to monitor sales place orders based on those sales track shipments to the distribution centers and coordinate the flow of materials and information throughout the system By the early s the companys investments in this information systemincluding satellite links to handle its immense amount of daily datatotaled more than millionWalMart reaped the full benefits arising from its extensive information systems when it shifted its focus from internal purposes to a means of interacting with suppliers In WalMart began its first major experiment in changing its relationship with a key supplier Procter Gamble by establishing the WalMart Retail Link program This program provided Procter Gamble with access to WalMarts pointofsales information allowing the supplier to track sales of its products on a realtime basis and manage its inventory accordingly In the words of Lou Pritchett Procter Gambles vice president of sales at the time PG could monitor WalMarts inventory and data and then use that information to make its own production and shipping plans with a great deal more efficiency We broke new ground by using information technology to manage our business together instead of just to audit itThe WalMartProcter Gamble partnership has been often cited by the business press The program began through an informal discussion between Sam Walton and Procter Gambles Pritchett Although the effort has been characterized as a partnership senior executives at Procter Gamble have also noted that the initial impetus came from Walton The partnership required WalMart to switch from its internal proprietary standard to a more widely adopted electronic data interchange EDI standard as well as to bar codes that were already in use by other retailers particularly Kmart Although Kmart was the first major retailer to experiment with EDI WalMart led the way in structuring supply relationships and its overall competitive strategy around information exchange The program soon expanded to other vendors including apparel suppliers who entered their own trading partnerships with WalMart Thus what began as a system focused on efficient distribution eventually evolved into the modern system of lean retailingNational Chains J C PenneyJ C Penney built an internal data communications network well in advance of its use with suppliers Pointofsale terminals first appeared at its stores in the mids allowing the company to capture information on storelevel sales Penney was also one of the first retailers to adopt scanner technologies Although early forays into electronic data management relied on mainframe computers between and the company installed cash registers equipped with microprocessors and storage capabilitiesThese storelevel investments were accompanied by major capital investments in central computer processing capacities continuing development of store and corporatelevel software systems and improvements in distribution operations In the late s Penney drew on these systems to allow corporate buyers in its Plano Texas headquarters to display potential products to geographically dispersed individual store merchandisers who with store managers had considerable autonomy within the company This information infrastructure proved most beneficial when it gave Penneys major vendors access to sales data via direct broadcast satellite There was initial resistance however Despite the companys offer to provide suppliers with EDI downloads many declined because of their inability to process the data It was only when Penney provided aggregated reports via fax to account executives that a thousand vendors agreed By Penney was using EDI for processing percent of purchase orders and percent of invoices with of its suppliers Nonetheless many small suppliers did not have electronic links with the companyIt is no accident that such innovative information and distribution relationships with key suppliers emerged through WalMart Kmart and a national chain like J C Penney rather than among department or specialty stores The larger size of these mass merchants facilitated adoption of rapidreplenishment practices as a result of economies of scale in inbound and outbound transportation information technology and distribution center operations Indeed the adoption of these distribution innovations parallels the emergence of department stores and mailorder houses a century earlierBoth mass merchants and national chains cover a more narrow range of productsprimarily basic apparel itemsthan department stores Basic products are prime candidates for lean retailing because such a product style remains in a retailer and apparel companys product line over much of the selling season and often over several years That makes it easier to use information acquired during the selling season for replenishment during the same season or for forecasting future demand Basic items also represent a major percentage of all apparel goods sold In our HCTAR sample percent of all shipments by business units weighted by sales volume could be classified as basic Therefore given their scale and product mix it is not surprising that WalMart Kmart and J C Penney were among the early pioneers of lean retailingDepartment Stores Dillards and FederatedAlthough providing consumers with low prices for a limited range of goods underpins the strategy of mass merchants and national chains department stores going back to Wanamaker rely on offering consumers a diverse and exciting collection of goods The focus of department stores tends to be on the middle and higher portion of the fashion triangle consequently lean retailing came later to this segment of the industryDillards was a pioneer in the use of information technology for tracking and responding to sales Dillards became one of the first department stores in the late s to build a centralized inventorytracking system to provide its headquarters in Little Rock Arkansas with realtime information on sales by both store and item This entailed buying and then adapting early scanning technologies for use at sales counters and for pointofsale data collection Dillards also purchased computing capacity for individual stores and its headquarters office along with the necessary equipment to connect stores to the head office via electronic data transmissionWith these systems in place it began to develop distribution centers capable of being efficient intermediaries between its suppliers and stores Finally like the mass merchants and national chains Dillards started insisting that its suppliers invest in corresponding technologies to allow electronic reordering and to meet its increasingly stringent service requirements But unlike a mass merchant that typically manages over separate items in a large store the Dillards system uses this information to manage over one million SKUs in one of its flagship storesFederated originated as a decentralized federation of wellknown stores like Richs and Bloomingdales with wide variation in both its merchandising and backroom activities Like Dillards its stores carry a vast array of products a typical department store may have items its flagship Macys in midtown Manhattan offers more than two million separate SKUs During the s however the amount of inventory held by Federated ballooned while it faced bankruptcyUnder CEO Alan Questrom the company addressed these problems by attempting to increase its inventory turns the number of times a year that goods turned over in its stores and reduce its exposure to losses from excess inventories This entailed instituting aggressive markdown policies in the short term to remove large inventories that had built up in many divisions and stores At the same time the company began to redesign its logistics systemthe method it used to move goods from suppliers through warehouses and to delivery at storesThe size of Federateds logistics challenge can be captured by the following figures In the company moved over million units from its suppliers to its stores requiring an average of truck deliveries per day which amounted to thirty million miles for deliveries per year Like Dillards J C Penney and others Federated spent millions of dollars on installing scanners adopting bar codes and EDI to communicate internally and with suppliers Given the size of its logistics challenge Federated also chose to redesign its methods of moving goods from suppliers to stores With the establishment of an independent operating unit Federated Logistics this retailer reduced the amount of time required to process merchandise in distribution centers by percent to an average of two daysMeanwhile the company sought to maintain the strengths of its divisionsMacys and Bloomingdales in particularin merchandising It created among other innovations a team buying system that centralizes certain buying functions to benefit from potential economies of scale while taking full advantage of divisional expertise regarding different customer groups within Federateds stores Yet a tension exists between its desire to provide customers with a changing variety of apparel fashions and the need to increase its capacity to replenish a higher percentage of products thereby taking advantage of its expertise in logistics Increasingly a department store must be successful at both pursuits We discuss the tradeoff arising from providing new products with little information on consumer demand fashion products and replenishing items on the basis of sales historically limited to more basic products in detail in Chapter Although WalMarts rapid climb has created the most sound and fury a variety of retailers adopted and adapted different pieces of lean retailing in the early s Note that the push toward rapid replenishment reduction of lead times and what has often been called quick response came predominately from retailers rather than from their apparel suppliersThe next chapter analyzes the building blocks of lean retailing drawing on the retailers described above as well as others Chapter discusses how the retail revolution has led to a tremendous shift in bargaining power within the channelaway from manufacturers and suppliers and toward lean retailers William Dillards simple maxim succinctly captures the centraland perennialinventory challenge facing retail managers To make a sale a retailer must have on its wagon the product the customer wants Absence of an item often translates into a lost sale and reduced revenues and profits The magnitude of such lost sales for retailers can be significant For example in roughly percent of customers who entered a Macys store left without making a purchase because the product they were seeking was not available On the other hand the retail wagon should not be too full since stocking retail shelves with unpopular items also results in excess coststhe cost of capital tied up in unwanted goods the opportunity cost of the space that could be used for products that customers would buy if present and ultimately lost margin when retailers must resort to price markdowns or product disposal to clear languishing items from their shelvesThe main goal of retail inventory strategy is to maximize profitability by managing the inherent tension between stocking too much and stocking too little Retail buyers of old grappled with this problem as they do today But as product variety has increased and product life cycles have shortened this tension has become increasingly acute prompting inventory management practices to evolve in recent years to meet rapidly changing market demands Although a seemingly mundane tactical aspect of business a firms inventory strategy reflects its approach to managing risk Indeed the inventory strategies chosen by firms in a supply channeland the congruence of those policies across channel partnershave enormous implications for the channels speed flexibility and profitabilityConceptually retail inventory management is straightforward enough Forecast demand for a product order the product in the appropriate quantity stock it in the right retail locations keep track of its sales and the resulting inventory levels and replenish its store inventories if possible either from the manufacturer if it offers replenishment services for that product or from the retailers central warehouse if the retailer had purchased a large quantity of the product in advance of the selling season In practice however retail inventory management is fraught with challenges such as long and uncertain orderfulfillment lead times and errors in product identification and record keeping Consider for instance how many store clerks still scan items incorrectly at the register A customer may purchase three similar polo shirts in different colors or sizes but because the price is the same for all the clerk may simply scan one of them three timeslosing important information about consumer color andor size preferences Even without such obvious errors forecasting demand at the SKU level has become difficult as an ever wider array of products cycle through stores Many lean retailing practices are rooted in retailers attempts to deal with growing demand uncertainty In this environment ordering large quantities of products far in advance of the selling season is simply too costly Retailers now prefer to place relatively small orders before the season and then observe consumer response to the product offering before ordering more As we described in Chapter many have transformed their warehouses into modern distribution centers to facilitate the receipt and distribution of these smaller ordersThe forecasting and inventory models presented in this chapter are not new they have been recommended for years by statisticians and operations researchers However until the s retailers had neither the data collection and computing capabilities required to execute these models effectively nor the tremendous impetus to implement them that lean retailing has precipitated Because the effects of lean retailing are sweeping across many industries it is imperative that everyone involved understand how inventory policies have been affected This chapter covers the key steps in retail inventory management forecasting demand choosing appropriate stocking strategies and determining order quantities and frequencies Although few retailers have embraced the complete set of forecasting and inventory models described in this chapter lean retailers are moving in that directionThe Retail Forecasting ChallengeWe first turn to the problem of forecasting sales in retail stores Imagine trying to predict how many women will walk into a particular downtown Boston store next week prepared to pay full price for a size pair of Levi blue jeans with long pant length loose fit stonewashed finish and a pleated waistin other words one particular SKU out of thousands How will that compare to the number who would buy the same product but with a short pant length How does a retail buyer even begin to approach the problem of making forecasts at such a minute level of detailThe buyer might start by trying to get historical data on the weekly sales of those Levi jeans in the store But waitshould that be on the sales of those jeans throughout the Greater Boston area Should the buyer base her prediction on sales of only this particular size and style or would it be more accurate to look at the sales of all jeans in this style and then multiply by the percent of all jean styles sold that were size long Maybe she should restrict herself to this years data to ensure that it is as current as possible On the other hand one would hate to lose the information that might be contained in past years selling patternsThe complexity of the problem even for basic blue jeans is staggering Now consider the same exercise for a new dress style not previously available at retailperhaps a style that gained attention when worn by a controversial film star at the most recent Academy Awards ceremony How many of these dresses will sell this season Specifically how many will sell in a darkpeach tone in size If the challenge of making such predictions for this seasons sales is not sufficiently daunting try predicting how many of each item will sell during a given period next yearThe impossibility of making accurate predictions of demand long in advance of the selling seasonespecially at the SKU levelis clear But because products are manufactured and ordered by SKU some attempt must be made to forecast demand at that level Most retailers have to make demand forecasts for products in two different categories existing products for which historical sales data are available and new products with no selling history The following section discusses the first category and provides general background on the elements of a demand forecast It is followed by a short discussion of new product forecastingForecasting Demand for Products with a Selling HistoryCreating a forecast for a product that the retailer has sold in the past starts with collecting and analyzing historical selling data Those data provide insight into historical trends and suggest how the products sales are related to other factors like weather holidays special advertising campaigns general economic indicators or simply the passage of time Air conditioners sell in greater quantities during summer months for example neckties just before Fathers Day and consumer electronics when the economy is booming Once these relationships are understood predictions of future sales can be made although a high level of uncertainty is always involved Before discussing how one might analyze the trends in historical data it is important to recognize three often overlooked aspects of demand forecastingThree Caveats About ForecastingFirst of all a products selling history is only representative of future sales if the product is sold in a stable environment For the blue jeans discussed above the selling environment will remain stable as long as competitors do not introduce competing products that draw from Levis demand fashion preferences do not change a new more desirable type of denim is not introduced that customers prefer and the economy does not dip into a recession However even for a basic product like blue jeans it is unlikely that all these assumptions will hold Given the volatile nature of demand in many industries an assumption of stability is suspect meaning that forecasts based on historical sales data may be less accurate than the historical data suggest Consequently lean retailers prefer to forecast demand set target inventory levels and place orders on a weekly basis because the selling environment is much more likely to be stable into the next week than months into the futureSecond most firms gather sales data not demand data Customers rarely inform the sales clerk in a typical retail store if a desired product is out of stock they either buy a different product or leave the store without making a purchase Directmail firms such as catalog companies and those that sell via television or the Internet are important exceptions Because the customer must write call or email these retailers with a specific purchase request these firms are able to capture actual consumer demand rather than sales numbers alone Such retailers can also gather data about customer demographics past purchases and responses to potential substitute items all of which add up to a gold mine of information about consumer preferencesIn fact the value of such data may induce traditional store retailers to offer incentives for customers to share their demand preferences even when the product is not available in stock In the mids Nordstrom ran newspaper ads promising for certain products that if the size or color of an item the customer wished to purchase was not in stock at the store Nordstrom would locate the desired item and mail it to the customer at no additional costboth the item and its delivery were free Not surprisingly Nordstrom limited this offer to a small number of basic styles and sizes and to one item per customer The only thing a customer had to do was tell a sales clerk what he or she wantedThis approach has benefits on three fronts the retailer avoids a lost sale and its associated margin a potentially dissatisfied customer is delighted by the stores additional service and free product and last but certainly not least for a very small feethe wholesale cost of the product and shipping feesNordstrom gains critical information about consumer demand Without such programs retailers may find it difficult to judge how demand is faring after a product stocks out at the retail site and therefore may have trouble making sensible reordering decisionsThe third caveat to bear in mind is that a point forecast a single number alone has relatively low value If a buyer forecasts that customer demand for size Levi jeans next week in one of its stores will be ten pairs what does that mean Will exactly ten pairs sell Is ten the most likely number to sellor will at least ten pairs sell A forecast consisting only of a single number provides no indication of the degree of uncertaintyIndeed the purpose of the forecasting process is to provide a basis for deciding how many units of a given product should be shipped to a store to minimize the coststhat is risksof over and undersupply But risk exists precisely because retailers are uncertain about what demand will be for their products Therefore to provide a useful basis for making decisions that minimize risk a forecast should include an explicit assessment of the relative likelihood of different demand levels occurring Our buyer might capture this information by saying that there is a percent probability that weekly demand for size jeans in the store will fall between two and seventeen units with an expected value of ten units She might add that there is a percent probability that demand will fall between six and thirteen units Figure shows a demand distribution having these properties Note that there is a percent chance that demand will be less than seventeen units next weekthus if our buyer decides to stock seventeen units at the beginning of the week the store should be able to offer a percent order fulfillment rate on this SKU It is only with such probabilistic forecasts which explicitly characterize uncertainty that retailers can make inventory stocking decisions that minimize riskFour Components of Historical Demand DataWith these caveats in mind lets assume our store buyer has representative historical demand data for blue jeans for the last few years She will first analyze the historical data by separating the causes of past changes in demand into the following categories trend seasonality cyclicality and random fluctuationThe trend in demand data describes a medium to longterm growth or decline Such trends occur in all industries and can be steadily increasing steadily decreasing or varying over time Seasonality describes withinyear trends that are associated with the season of the year and that occur year after year For example Figure shows weekly demand for mens dress shirts at a particular retailer There are seasonal peaks in demand at Fathers Day and Christmas when many shirts are bought as gifts Cyclicality in demand describes longerterm gradual rises and declines that are typically associated with aggregate business activity For example demand for new automobiles tends to increase during times of economic prosperity and decrease during recessionary periodsThe final component of a demand distribution random fluctuation is perhaps the most critical it is also the most difficult to assess and incorporate into inventory planning Essentially random fluctuation in demand cannot be explained by trends seasonality cyclicality or other factors like advertising and new product introduction Examine Figure In addition to the seasonal trend associated with major holidays random fluctuation in shirt sales occurred from week to week For our purposes note that high demand fluctuation decreases ones ability to forecast demand accuratelyBuilding a Demand ForecastAfter completing an analysis of how different factors relate to past demand fluctuations our buyer can draw inferences about what future demand for womens blue jeans might be in her store next week In this case we assume a stable environment specifically that past relationships among variables are representative of future relationships among those variables Although this may not be a realistic assumption for many situations it makes it easier to understand the fundamentals of demand forecasting hereLets assume that the stores demand for the size Levis jeans last week can be described by the distribution in Figure Lets also assume that the average demand each week has been growing at a rate of about percent so that the average demand for the next week should be units for the following week about units and so on Then the expected average demand is the solid black trend line shown in Figure The buyer could incorporate demand uncertainty into the forecast by indicating different possible values of demand and the likelihood of that actual demand will fall within those values For example in Figure the lines directly above and below the solid trend line indicate a range of demand for which the likelihood of demand falling within that range is percent The lines further from the trend line indicate the range with a likelihood of percent Thus for week there is a percent probability that demand will be between two units and seventeen units exactly as depicted in Figure Predicting what customers will do when they walk into the store will always be challenging but the buyer can be confident that if she stocks seventeen units at the beginning of the next week she has a percent probability of meeting all consumer demand on this productForecasting Demand for New ProductsOf course when a product has just been launched and no historical data exist on which to base a forecast retailers confront additional challenges In this case most companies resort to informal forecasting methods A common approach is to forecast by analogyusing data for similar products that have been on the market previously One might assume for example that sales for this years new fashion will be similar to those for last years new fashion This is clearly a subjective call but once made it gives retailers a basis for predicting demand patterns for a new productObviously forecasting demand for new products accurately requires a broad understanding of consumer preferences and market trends Fisher Hammond Obermeyer and Raman have introduced a method that proved successful in predicting demand for new fashion skiwear as part of an Accurate Response forecasting and planning approach This approach combined individual forecasts by members of the companys Buying Committee creating a probabilistic forecast whose uncertainty was determined by the level of agreement among forecasts made by individual managers Statistical analysis showed that those garments for which the Buying Committee had the greatest disagreement were indeed those with the greatest demand uncertainty The skiwear firm has credited the Accurate Response approach with increasing its profits by nearly twothirdsThe Impact of Product Variety on Forecast UncertaintyThe forecasting challenges retailers confront have been amplified in recent years by product proliferation in almost every category As a result demand forecast uncertainty has grown substantially thereby increasing the level of inventory that must be held to meet customer service requirements High demand uncertainty previously associated only with fashion products is now pervasive characterizing even those items once regarded as basicssuch as power tools industrial seals mens dress shirts and blue jeansA good rule of thumb for understanding how product proliferation affects demand uncertainty is that the demand uncertainty for a product category increases as the square root of the number of products in the category assuming that the total demand for the product category remains unchanged and that the individual items in the category have demand distributions that are statistically independent and identically distributed A common standardized measure of demand uncertainty the coefficient of variation Cvdefined as the standard deviation of the demand distribution divided by the mean of the demand distributionfor a specific product is proportional to the square root of the number of products offered For example increasing the number of products offered in a category by a factor of four say from fifty items to without increasing total demand in the category would increase the coefficient of variation for each individual product by a factor of two And as well see in the next section doubling the demand uncertainty roughly doubles the amount of finished goods required to provide the same level of product availability in the storeTherefore product variety is costly due to the increased demand uncertainty associated with each unit Retailers thus must either limit product variety or change their way of doing business so as to minimize the impact of high variety Lean retailing is the major such change that retailers are adopting to reduce significantly the costs associated with product varietySetting Inventory Levels in the StoreAfter completing the process of developing a demand forecast for each SKU a retailer must determine how much of each item to stock on the shelves of its stores Retailers have an incentive to stock high levels of inventory They want both to provide sufficient display stock to attract customersempty shelves are not invitingand to have products available for those who wish to purchase them Yet carrying inventory is expensive Retailers pay capital costs for having their money tied up in inventory for the physical floor space necessary to store goods and for handling managing and monitoring the inventory Most important they pay a risk premium for carrying products that might become obsolete either because they are damaged or fall out of fashionA retailers decision about what to stock will depend on a variety of considerations including the demand forecast for the product the level of product availability it wishes to provide to customers the frequency with which it will place replenishment orders and the lead time to acquire replenishment units Well describe later in this chapter how these factors affect retail inventory policy A number of other straightforward costs are associated with any inventory stocking policy such as the cost of ordering and transporting product the cost of determining inventory levels and the impact on purchase price of any quantity price discountsIn order to evaluate the performance of different inventory options it is important to emphasize the less straightforward costs involved Take the two primary types of inventory errors a firm can make stocking too much of an item the customer does not want and stocking too little of something the customer does want Although the categories for the costs of mismatched supply and demand are simple in concept in reality they are difficult to measure accurately Evaluating forced markdown costs is hard for example because one must separate markdowns made for promotional reasons from those made to liquidate stock that cannot be sold at full price The difficulty of measuring these costs is further exacerbated by the fact that a given product may be attractive to different consumers at different prices so determining the appropriate full price for a product is not an easy taskStockout costs are also complex To determine the magnitude of a stockout cost for a unit one must understand consumer behavior Will the customer buy a substitute item if a particular item is out of stock or return to the same store at a later date to purchase the item when it is again in stock In these cases stockout costs are minimal But the customer may leave the store because a desired item was not in stock thereby not purchasing anything else that means the stockout cost would equal the margin on all the products the customer would have otherwise purchased In the most extreme case a stockout might cause a customer to switch retailers costing the lifetime value of that customer and others who might defect due to negative wordofmouthIn addition it is useful to divide the items retailers order into two groups those for which additional units can be obtained from the supplier during the selling season for that product and those that cannotthat is replenishable products versus nonreplenishables This distinction matters because inventory management differs for products in the two categories All else being equal a retailer would prefer to have replenishment opportunities for every product Lean retailers rapid replenishment arrangements radically reduce the risk of undersupplythe retailer can essentially correct for those items that it ordered too little of prior to the start of the seasonand of oversupply since the retailer orders smaller initial quantities In contrast orders for nonreplenishable products must be placed in full prior to observing consumer demand for the product The retailer rolls the dice and makes its entire order commitment based on preliminary demand forecasts considerably increasing the risk of over or undersupplyInventory Models for Nonreplenishable ProductsWhen a retailer has no ability to replenish a product the inventory decision is reduced to a single question How many units of the item should a buyer order to maximize that products profitability Retailer managers are relying less and less on their gut and past experience lean retailers are increasingly using more sophisticated statistical models even in the risky realm of nonreplenishables to help guide stocking decisions In this section we review briefly the wellknown newsvendor problem to illustrate the basic tradeoffs retailers must make when determining inventory stocking levelsTo determine the optimal quantity for a SKU the retailer finds the number of units to order so that the expected marginal cost of stocking an additional unit and not being able to sell it equals the expected marginal cost of not stocking that unit when it would have sold if available Mathematically this relationship translates as followsFind the optimal inventory stocking quantity Q that satisfies the relationshipProbability the unit cannot be soldCo Probability the unit could have been soldCuthat is ProbDQCo ProbDQCuwhere Q the optimal order quantityD demand for the productCo cost of oversupplyCu cost of undersupplyAt the simplest level the optimal stocking policy for nonreplenishable goods is to stock the quantity Q that satisfies ProbDQ CuCuCo For example suppose a retailer can purchase a dress for that it sells for Suppose also that if the retailer stocks too many of these dresses it can only sell the leftovers for each In this case the cost of oversupply comes to because the retailer loses that much on every leftover dress Conversely the retailer loses whenever it stocks out of a dress that a customer would have purchased at full price According to the model the retailer should purchase the quantity Q that will yield ProbDQ that is a percent probability that demand for the dress will be less than the quantity purchasedWith this analysis completed the retailer must next forecast demand for the dress at the SKU level A sample demand forecast for the dress appears in Figure The buyer should order units since there is a percent probability that demand will be less than this Note that this buyer would be ordering more than she expects to sell the mean value of the distribution units This makes sense because the margins on these dresses are high relative to the cost of buying additional dresses and having to dispose of them below costInventory Model for Replenishable ProductsAlthough determining an inventory policy for nonreplenishable products continues to be an issue for retailers inventory decisions that involve replenishables have undergone the most change with the advent of lean retailing Indeed many products sold in retail outlets particularly basic and fashionbasic items can now be replenished after the start of the selling season The jagged heavy line in Figure page depicts a typical inventory pattern for a replenishable product like our blue jeans in size Note that the inventory level drops gradually as consumers purchase the item Once a week this retailer places a replenishment order with its supplier and receives a shipment On July and the replenishment order arrives in time to restock the inventory before selling out however during the week of July high demand led to rapid depletion of stock so the retailer stocks out of the product prior to the end of the weekTo understand this products inventory requirements it helps to divide the inventory into two separate components cycle stock which is held to cover expected demand for the product and safety stock which is held to cover higher than expected demand Figure breaks out these two components of stock The straight dashed lines show the inventory pattern that would result if there were no variation in demandthat is if exactly the same number of units were bought each day Specifically the dashed lines indicate the inventory pattern that would result if demand each day were equal to the average or expected demand In the figure cycle stock is the amount of stock necessary to meet average demand Below the cycle stock sits the safety stock a buffer that is held for those weeks such as the one following July in which demand exceeds the average If there were no uncertainty in demand this retailer would need no safety stock But the higher the demand uncertainty the more safety stock is required to ensure a low probability of stocking outAs Figure shows the safety stock needed to achieve a given customer service level is proportional to the standard deviation of the demand forecast Simply put the less certain retailers are of the demand for their product the more safety stock they must hold to meet consumer needs In the figure we assume that the orderfulfillment rate equals percent and the orderfulfillment lead time is three weeks The parameter choices for the figures although based on data from actual apparel firms are for illustrative purposes only By reducing orderfulfillment lead times lean retailers are able to reduce the level of safety stock required to deal effectively with a given level of demand variationBecause safety stock is directly dependent on demand uncertainty increasing product variety increases retail safetystock requirements For example when the coefficient of variation increases from to which would happen if the number of products offered increased by a factor of fourthe amount of finished goods required to provide the desired service level doubles Formally one determines safetystock levels by weighing the costs of having too much inventory overstocking with the costs of having too little understocking in much the same way as we did for nonreplenishablesFrom the retailers point of view the only way to mitigate the effects of increased demand uncertainty is to have frequent replenishment opportunities in which replenishment orders can be filled by manufacturers with very short lead times Chapter examines what this entails from the manufacturers perspective At this point however we will introduce the standard inventory model that many retailers use for rapid replenishment items considering the implications of demand uncertainty raised aboveR s S Models Traditional Inventory Policy for ReplenishablesA standard inventory policy for a retailer proceeds as follows At the end of every week check the inventory of your product If the inventory has fallen below a stated amount s termed the reorder point place an order for more units The amount ordered should be sufficient so that the number of units on hand plus those that are on order equal some maximum stocking quantity S For a particular item our store buyer may reorder when the inventory level falls below s equals units in a quantity that brings the current inventory up to S equals units With this policy in place if at the end of a day she notes that inventory has dropped to units she would order more as shown in Figure The parameter R in this model refers to the length of the time period between inventory status checks in this case the buyer checks inventory weekly so R is daysNote that there is a short delivery lead time from the time the order is placed one day during the first two cycles shown in the figure two days for the third cycle Because units typically are sold during the delivery lead time the actual inventory in stock rarely reaches eight units Instead at the time of ordering inventory in stock plus that on order equals eight units But if order lead times are long the buyer must order up to a larger number S to meet demand during the replenishment lead time Once again if lead times are uncertain retailers must hold additional safety stock to meet demand in the event of an unusually long lead time It can be shown that high variability in lead time means higher costs for retailers than somewhat longer but more reliable lead times that is it may be better to have a longer reliable lead time than an unpredictable one with a shorter average duration The lean retailing policies described previously attempt to reduce both average lead times and leadtime variability through the imposition for example of penalties for late deliveriesWe noted earlier that a retailers decision about how much to stock depends on the demand forecast for the product the level of product availability it wishes to provide to customers the frequency with which it will place replenishment orders and the lead time to acquire replenishment units Lets see how these factors would combine to create a stocking policy for our size blue jeans We continue to assume that this SKU has the weekly demand distribution shown in Figure page Assume that the retailer wishes to provide a percent orderfulfillment rate for this SKU that the retailer checks inventory once per week and that the manufacturers lead time to deliver replenishment units is overnight This last assumption is unrealistic in many situations we choose it only to simplify the exposition It is not difficult to extend this analysis to the case in which the replenishment lead time is longer Finally we assume that like most retailers our retailer replenishes each week exactly the number of units that sold the previous week Formally this translates into an R s S policy with s S that is if the current stock is S or less the retailer orders S sGiven the desired percent service level the retailer should set a target stock level of seventeen units Thus the retail replenishment system would check the stock of these jeans every Sunday night if the current stock is thirteen pairs of size jeans meaning that four pair sold the previous week then it would automatically order four more pairs bringing the amount of this SKU up to its target level of seventeen units This order would be combined with other replenishment orders for Levi jeans destined for the same store thereby reducing shipping costsPeriodic Versus Continuous ReviewThe policy described above involves what is known as periodic review After a fixed period of time eg every week the retailer checks the inventory level If the level of inventory is less than the specified reorder point s the retailer orders up to the specified level S This is still the most common practice todayAn alternative approach offers continuous reviewor an s S modelin which the retailer continuously checks the inventory level The moment the level hits s the retailer orders up to a specified quantity S Unlike a periodicreview policy in which retailers may order when the inventory level is less than s with a continuousreview policy they always order when the inventory equals s Thus under a continuousreview policy retailers always order the same quantity Q S s but after a variable amount of time since the last order was placed Conversely under periodic review they order after a fixed length of time but the quantity differs because it depends on the amount that is in stock when inventory was checked each period Use of continuous review allows retailers to achieve a higher service level with a lower amount of inventory By monitoring the inventory continuously they ensure that it never falls below s before placing an orderThe choice of which model to use depends on a number of factors Prior to the use of bar codes implementation of a continuousreview policy at retail was nearly impossible because it was extraordinarily difficult to keep track of actual inventory levels on a continuous basis Today bar codes and retail information systems allow access to stocking levels on a continuous basis but most retailers choose to use periodic review systems to restrict ordering activities to set times of the week that way they can save on transportation and other costs by ordering multiple products from the same vendor at the same timeFinally a complete economic analysis of the appropriate parameters for an s S or R s S policy must include consideration of some of the softer costs and benefits of inventory A retail buyer may choose to stock more of a product than indicated by an economic analysis because she believes that more stock is necessary to attract the customer and sustain the desired level of sales In recent years many retailers have been hampered in their efforts to reduce instore stocking levels by the size and shape of the fixtures in which their products are displayed If the fixture was designed to hold ten shirts of a particular color and size for instance it is both wasteful of space and visually unappealing to put only three shirts outeven if an economic analysis recommends the lower quantity In fact many stores have introduced new fixtures with smaller slots for each SKU or flexible slot sizes that can hold a more economically desirable quantity of stock without sacrificing pleasing appearanceVendorManaged InventoryOne of the most significant changes in retail inventory management in recent years has been the introduction of vendormanaged inventoryVMI programs also known as Continuous Replenishment Programs CRP or Continuous Product Replenishment CPR These programs involve having either the retailer the manufacturer or the retailer and manufacturer together determine desired inventory stocking levels for the manufacturers product in the retail store After these model stock levels are set data about product sales and current retail inventory levels are transmitted electronically to the manufacturer The manufacturer then decides how much to shipand in many cases when to shipto the retailer in such a way that its own costs of manufacturing and shipping are minimized while still meeting retail inventory policy requirements Typically these programs result in the frequent delivery of small quantities of items to the retailerit would not be uncommon for a blue jeans manufacturer to ship a carton of one dozen blue jeans of mixed styles and sizes to a particular storeThe benefits of such policies are significant In the grocery industry the implementation of VMI programs has been shown to increase retail inventory turns from percent to percent over those achieved prior to implementation even if the retailer and manufacturer had previously used electronic data interchange for communication of retail orders The advantage of using VMI programs stems from the retailer and manufacturer working together to determine a flow of shipments that optimizes the economics of the two parties as a system Otherwise the two parties make independent decisions that myopically optimize their own profits without complete consideration of the impact these decisions may have on other players in the channelA few caveats are in order however According to HCTARs survey the incidence of retail model stock programs increased significantly over the period from percent to percent of total volume shipped by the business units in our sample see Figure page But there was a much smaller increase in the prevalence of model stock programs governed by apparel suppliers reflecting the dominance of retailers in instigating new channel relationships as well as the reluctance of most retailers to allow suppliers to control merchandise on the shelf As in all cases where partnerships might benefit the various parties involved realworld considerationswho has the most power who is responsible for instigating change who will make the initial investmentsoften slow integrationManaging Inventory in a Lean Retailing EnvironmentThe new world of rapid replenishment implies additional capabilities for both the retailer and manufacturer The retailer must be able to gather and synthesize pointofsales data quickly to determine what has sold and then update its demand forecast for the product accordingly The manufacturer must deliver the ordered product quickly to the retailer As we describe in Chapter manufacturers have essentially two choices in supplying replenishables They can hold finished products in inventory thereby reducing their processing requirements during the replenishment lead time to picking packing and shipping the order However this approach increases the risk to the manufacturer It has to commit to holding finished goods of a product for which it has little or no consumer demand informationThe alternative is to adopt quickresponse manufacturing strategies that allow items to be produced to order But given the increasingly short lead times dictated by retailers often just a couple of days most manufacturers cannot produce in this way Therefore it is not surprising that most replenishment products are basics or fashionbasics with relatively stable demand Manufacturers are unwilling to hold speculative stock to meet replenishment requests from retailers for fashion products because the risk of holding those fashion goods in finished goods inventory is too highIronically replenishment capabilities would be of most value to the retailer for fashion products but because of their short product lives and the unpredictability of demand fashion products are typically not offered on a replenishment basis From the apparel suppliers perspective thats a good thingat least for the time being As the next chapter will make clear the demands of lean retailing have already created plenty of inventory challenges for manufacturers Retailers calls to apparel manufacturers about late delivery are the basis for many a tall tale at retail conventions In the past the standard reply to a query about what had happened to an order was Its on the loading dock Information systems at apparel factories were primitive If all the SKUs for an order were not in the warehouse substitutions of the same style in a different size would be offered to the retailer Or retailers might not even notice if an unplanned substitution had been made because their information systems were equally as primitive If there were insufficient SKUs of the requested style the order would be shorted or a phone call made to the retail buyer to negotiate a solution to the problem If no SKUs of the order were in the finished goods warehouse then the search of the factory floorwhere there might be tens of thousands of partially completed items to look throughwould beginThen along came lean retailing and the need for rapid replenishmentmanufacturers are now expected to replenish products in less than a week At first only a few retailers required this and apparel manufacturers tried to meet these needs with minimal changes in their internal practices Often this was done at the expense of a manufacturers nonlean retail customers For example the CEO of a mens dressshirt supplier reported to us in that its finished goods warehouse was divided into two areas A locked section contained finished goods reserved for orders from Dillards Inc this manufacturers biggest customer and its only one with stringent rapidreplenishment requirements The rest of the warehouse held inventory for all other retailers If the locked section had insufficient inventory for a Dillards order product from the rest of the warehouse could be picked and sent to Dillards but no retailers could receive products from the locked section reserved for Dillards no matter how severe their needs This arrangement worked well from Dillards perspective it found this firm to be one of its best rapidreplenishment suppliers with high orderfulfillment rates and ontime deliveriesthe main criteria for success For the manufacturer it meant a larger finished goods inventory and worse service for its other customersAs long as only one or two retailers required rapid replenishment manufacturers could get away with this type of solution But it didnt take long before most retailers wanted orders for basic apparel items replenished this way and they became very demanding As an increasing number of suppliers are dancing to the demands of rapid replenishment they are finding it a complex tune Manufacturers suddenly have much more to do than just make clothingthey are being asked to do work previously done by the retailer such as picking and packing the order for each store from the retailers warehouse Each stores order has to be put in a separate carton labeled with its own bar code and accompanied by an advance shipping notice Moreover retailers want an order to arrive at their distribution center at an exact time If the truck is late the driver often has to wait until the end of the day to unload if allowed to do so at all Deliveries made a day late are sometimes refused and sent backSuch retail requirements have certainly put substantial pressure on apparel manufacturers to change their own practices Chapter described some of the basic changes many manufacturers are making to stay in the game with lean retailers But even if lean retailing has led to suppliers widescale adoption of bar codes and EDIrelated capabilities divergent production strategies among suppliers have emerged Conceivably two business units could each meet the same lean retailing requirements yet have very different internal practices and performance One could raise finished goods inventories substantially like the dressshirt manufacturer described above the other could make crucial operational changes to reduce manufacturing lead times However in light of the growth of rapid replenishment our research predicts that the performance of these two units will vary over time with the supplier that has implemented flexible planning and shortcycle production processes coming out ahead By investing in these practices apparel suppliers have the potential to satisfy lean retailing performance standards without bearing the costs of greatly expanded inventory in their own operations From our standpoint holding high inventories to meet rapid replenishment demands is strictly a shortterm strategy for manufacturersThe increasing emphasis on rapid replenishment raises a related question can offshore manufacturers meet retailers requirements for such short delivery lead times and so many services More specifically what are the characteristics of products for which inexpensive long leadtime production is preferable to more costly production with extremely short lead times The models and analyses presented in this chapter help shed light on this critical questionWe begin this chapter with an overview of the impact of demand variability on a manufacturers own inventory and production planning processes Next we describe how apparel manufacturers can use statistical analysis and simulation to gain insight into inventory planning and production scheduling for products they offer in their rapid replenishment collections The first of two case studies illustrates how demand uncertainty affects a firms target inventory levels The second case study demonstrates how shortcycle production translates into inventory reduction for a manufacturer thereby radically reducing the increased exposure to inventory risk a manufacturer would otherwise face to meet lean retailers demands The chapter concludes by emphasizing the relationships among demand volatility manufacturing lead times and inventory levels addressing a critical decision apparel manufacturing firms face today Given two different apparel sources with different variable production costs and lead times how does a firm decide which products to make in each of the two plantsThe Key Role of Demand VariabilityThe most important thing we are doing is consumerization to be the best in the business in delivering products customized for what the consumer wants All of our initiatives are to drive consumer value And as we reduce costs we reinvest those savings in improving our consumer responsivenessMackey McDonald President and CEO VF Corporation Because being responsive to consumer tastes is central to lean retailing dealing with variability in demand has become crucial to suppliers competing in a lean retailing world Even for basic products demand varies from day to day and week to week Thus if a retailer follows the simplest strategy of ordering at the beginning of each week exactly those items that sold during the previous week manufacturers must be prepared to ship an unknown number of items each week Very few manufacturers can produce items in production quantities in the limited lead time retailers allow for replenishment and consequently they must fill such orders from finished goods inventory And as one would expect the higher the variation in weektoweek demand the more inventory a manufacturer must hold to meet a retailers high service expectationsBecause weekly demand variability is a key determinant of the finished inventory a manufacturer must hold each firm should conduct an assessment of the demand variability of each item in the product line Retailers require orders to be filled at the SKU level so such demand variability analyses should be conducted at the SKU level as wellWe conducted such an analysis of weekly demand for a US manufacturer of mens coats suits and blazers Figure depicts the weekly demand for one SKUa singlebreasted coat in one of the firms most popular sizes regularduring the first twentyfour weeks of the year Each weeks demand has been divided by the average demand over the twentyfour weeks therefore the average weekly demand is simply equal to on this normalized scale The important features of demand for scheduling coat production are contained in demand data presented in this normalized fashion Normalizing the data also allows us to keep this manufacturers actual demand volume confidential without obscuring the central information contained in the dataPlotting the data in this way allows us to focus on the deviation of the weekly demand from the average weekly demand Figure depicts the weekly demand for a different SKUthe same singlebreasted coatbut this time in a less popular size regular Again the normalized data highlights the weekly deviation from the average demand In this case there is greater weektoweek variation than for the more popular sizeThe amount of variation in weekly demand exhibited in Figure is quite remarkable especially if we consider that the manufacturers demand is based on the total sales of this SKU in over a thousand retail outlets each week It is important to note also that this product was not promoted at retail with discounted prices at any time during this period so the variation is not due to consumers preferring to purchase a product when it was on sale In addition the demand peak for the regular occurs in week which was only an average demand week for the regularIt is useful to outline the ordering and manufacturing processes on a weekly basis to see how this manufacturers inventory policies might differ for the two different sizes Suppose that as described in Chapter the retailer consolidates POS data for the previous weeks sales each Sunday night and places a replenishment order with our manufacturer On Monday the manufacturer processes the order picks and packs the desired items from finished goods inventory and ships them to the retailer and places a factory order to manufacture those items that it shipped that day Assume that the manufacturing lead timethe amount of time required to go from a production order to a product ready for shipping to retailis less than one week Then by the following Monday the items ordered the previous week would be completed at the factory and available in the manufacturers finished goods inventory At this point the manufacturers inventory is restored to the target level it had the previous week and is ready to fill the next weeks retail replenishment orderFor the popular regular coat weekly demand never exceeds twice the coats average demand Thus as long as the lead time for producing more coats in size regular is less than a week the manufacturer could hold two weeks worth of inventory and be able to fillimmediatelyretail orders that replenish the previous weeks demand That is it could set a target stock level of two weeks of finished goods inventory and be able to provide a very high customer service level defined here as orderfulfillment rate to retailersHowever for the low volume regular the maximum weekly demand is about four times the average To provide the same service level to retailers for both sizes our manufacturer must hold twice as many weeks of demand of finished goods for the regular than for the regular Note that we are comparing the inventory levels in terms of weeks of average demand which measures the ratio of the units of finished goods to average weekly sales In fact the actual number of units of finished goods inventory would be higher for the popular regular than for the low volume regular The point to keep in mind here is that compared to a products average demand more popular products required relatively less finished goods inventory than less popular ones Bear in mind that the actual sales of our manufacturers coats showed no seasonal variation If a product has seasonal sales trends then the manufacturers inventory must rise to meet customer demand during peak seasonal demand Furthermore if the manufacturing lead time exceeds one week the manufacturer faces more demand risk and therefore must hold even more inventoryAs explained in previous chapters variation in weekly demand can be characterized by a standardized measure the coefficient of variation or Cv Formally defined as the standard deviation of demand divided by average demand the coefficient of variation can be considered a measure of variation that is normalized it allows us to compare the variation of demand for different products even if the average demand of the two products is quite different The value of the coefficient can vary from zero if demand is exactly the same every week to numbers much greater than one for wildly fluctuating weekly demand In our analyses of demand patterns for different apparel products we have found that the most predictable items have Cvs in the to range But in most situations in which a firm provides a wide range of goods to customers some of its products will have low or moderate demand variation while others demand will vary a great deal As illustrated in the previous examples high volume products often have lower coefficients of variation than low volume products In Figure the high volume regular has a low Cv of In Figure the lower volume regular has a Cv equal to which means the weekly demand departs much more from the average This is a result of the familiar demand pooling argument which shows that the total variation for the sum of many customers demand is less than the sum of the variation in individual customers demandThe same argument can be used to explain why growing product variety has increased demand variation at the SKU level As variety grows demand is distributed among an increasing number of SKUs thereby reducing the pooling effects of demand aggregation Take the singlebreasted coat of our manufacturer which is sold through more than a thousand retail outlets The total yearly sales of all SKUs of this kind of coat are in the tens of thousands Yet sales of some of the less popular sizes such as the regular are only a few hundred a year When considered on a weekly basis this translates into average weekly demand across all retail outlets of less than ten units Therefore even a small swing in demand from week to week translates into high relative variationthat is into a high coefficient of variationFigure page plots the coefficient of variation for mens singlebreasted coats The graph shows that the SKUs with the lowest total yearly sales have the highest Cv values the largest variation in weektoweek demand The coat manufacturer will have to hold relatively more finished goods inventory of the low volume SKUs than of the high volume SKUsTaking demand variability into account becomes even more important given recent trends toward product proliferation Over time suppliers must manufacturer more and more goods that have the joint characteristics of low volume and high variability As a result product proliferation represents a shift in the curve relating sales volume and variability see Figure High demand variation similarly occurs during the beginning and end of a product life cycle This variation is due in part to the lower demand volumes during those periods relative to the middle of a products life but such fluctuations also occur because of the inherent uncertainty during the ramp up or ramp down of a products lifeDemand variation plays a central role in determining a manufacturers finished goods inventory levels In the following case studies we describe how demand variation can be used to determine a firms production and inventory planning processes These cases offer a rational approach to inventory management for manufacturers one that is premised on receiving accurate POS information from retailers and maintaining good working relationships with all channel playersfor example retail orders are not placed at the last minute and textile suppliers come through when they say they will Reality is messier of course retailers and suppliers often surprise manufacturers and the POS data are rarely perfect or may not even be available Yet these nagging problems do not negate the need for a new approach to inventory management they merely indicate how complicated supplier relationships have becomeCase Inventory Control at a Mens Coat ManufacturerOur first case study examines the inventory management practices at the mens coat manufacturer previously described This manufacturers standard approach to rapid replenishment requests was simply to carry large inventories The firm treated all SKUs alike it held the same number of weeks of demand for each SKU Specifically our manufacturer checked inventory of every item each week If the inventory of any item was ten weeks of demand or less the firm would place a production order for that item so that the current inventory plus the planned production was equal to fourteen weeks of demand This manufacturer essentially followed an R s S policy as described in Chapter with R time period between orders seven days S target inventory level fourteen weeks and s reorder point ten weeksNote that this response is not unusual Many manufacturers do not explicitly track and use information like weekly demand variation for different SKUs Currently no manufacturer we know of has implemented all the changes described here and in the following chapters In that respect this mens clothing supplier is representative of the industryIn our initial assessment we found that this manufacturer was in stock for most SKUs most of the timea pretty good result However we also noticed that the firm was out of stock for some items especially those with the most variable demand Managers first thought that was true just for its largest sizes but further analysis revealed that the company had the same problem with some small sizes as well as with some less popular styles The firm was stocking out of the low demand items which as described above suffered from relatively high demand variation This is illustrated in Table which shows the average orderfulfillment rate for products with different levels of demand variability assuming the same level of average demand is held for each SKUThe data suggest that when a manufacturer chooses the same inventory policy for all products its orderfulfillment rate for highly variable products is usually worse than for low variation products Such a policy rarely maximizes profits the manufacturer stocks out thereby losing the margin on the sale and the retailer which typically desires a consistent or at least predictable orderfill rate across items in a product group is unhappy Simply increasing inventory for all SKUs would be a poor allocation of investment further increasing the orderfill rate for those SKUs for which service levels are already high Thus for most manufacturers tracking weekly variation for different SKUs is essential and will help to guide a firm in setting appropriate inventory targets for each SKU To do this firms need a planning tool that translates demand variation into inventory targets by weighing for each SKU the opportunity for more sales against higher inventory carrying costsOnce demand variation for each SKU was determined for our mens coat manufacturer its managers faced the question of how to manage the inventory of the items in its rapid replenishment collection while maintaining a smooth flow of products through the sewing room Using traditional sewing operations it typically takes eight weeks to produce a coat from the time an order is issued for cutting to the moment the finished goods are hanging in a manufacturers distribution center Two weeks are spent in the cutting room where the cloth is spread cut inspected and has backing material fused to appropriate parts of the outer shell fabric Four weeks are spent in assembly processes The last two weeks involve final inspection repairs if necessary shipping to the distribution center and hanging the finished coats so they can be picked to fill individual orders for a given storeA mens suit coat or a blazer requires more than a hundred assembly operations compare this with only forty operations for a mens shirt it is one of the most complicated and expensive apparel items to make Although the number of operations partly determines how long it takes to get a garment through production other factors come into play including the firms policy about how many finished coats should be allowed to build up in workinprocess and finished goods inventory Given this manufacturers policy of ordering production only when inventory levels dropped below ten weeks with the production quantity set to restore the inventory to fourteen weeks the minimum production quantity for each item was four weeks of demand Thus at least four weeks of demanda large quantity for most productsof the same style and size could move through the sewing plant at one time minimizing setup costs for thread changes and the likeThe diagram in Figure depicts the production process including all product and information flows relevant to the inventory decision In general to maximize operating profit a manufacturer must know the factorys overall cycle time workinprocess carrying costs finished or hanging goods carrying costs unit production costs and unit selling price as well as the Cv for each SKU of a given style The manufacturer in this example effectively had limitless capacity to produce the singlebreasted coat since only approximately percent of the plants total capacity was devoted to producing a variety of rapid replenishment items This capacity could be invoked when necessary by putting aside the lower priority products made in the factoryOur approach to the problem was to use operations research techniques and computer simulations of demand to explore the appropriate inventory levels taking into account the statistical nature of the weekly demand for each of the SKUs for a style In our approach we assumed that an unfilled order was a lost sale with a lost profit Table reports the recommendations derived from the method Setting a target inventory level for each SKU that maximizes profit is the first step we did this using a computer simulation As expected the target inventory levels depend on a products demand variation The larger the variation is the higher the inventory level should be for an item to satisfy demand as shown in the fourth and fifth columns of Table The second and third columns of the table indicate our manufacturers standard approach to inventory and are included to allow comparison with the optimal policyThe optimal policy is one for which marginal increases or decreases in chosen inventory levels will not confer additional profits For example when demand for an item was quite variable with the highest Cv of the optimal policy called for placing a production orders when inventory dropped to twelve weeks of demand rather than the lower standard level of ten Put in a different way increasing the amount of inventory from the companys uniform level to the optimal level raised the manufacturers orderfulfillment rate to more than percent for all SKUs which raised profits more than it cost the manufacturer in terms of added inventory carrying cost As a result overall profits increased because of the change in inventory policyFollowing this strategy it is true that a manufacturer will carry more inventory for certain items Yet the percentage of time to percent in our simulation that the firm is in stock for these SKUs translates into more sales and fewer stockouts which increases gross margin and ultimately operating profit Because margin is primarily determined by the difference between the selling price and manufacturing and materials costs if the margin for a unit is high it pays to be almost always in stock The resulting profit accrues even after the higher finished goods carrying cost associated with larger inventory has been consideredThis view of production and inventory planning also provides a manufacturer with a more sophisticated tool for balancing alternative plant operating choices to maximize profits For example consider whether a manufacturer should cut fabric and assemble garments in smaller lots In order to make this decision for a SKU with a given level of demand variation this firms managers should weigh the increased unit costs arising from manufacturing smaller lots against the benefits this might create in shortening production lead times which would reduce the amount of inventory the firm must hold for that product Similarly the impact of alternative methods for reducing plant cycle time depends not only on the direct costs of changes but also on the reductions in inventory levels allowed by shorter lead timesFundamental to any resulting scenario is the idea of coupling inventory carrying costs to other manufacturing costs in order to make optimal production planning decisions This allows manufacturers to balance the potentially higher operating costs associated with decreasing lot sizes the minimum number of units in a production run with the opportunities to reduce inventory carrying costs and increasing sales The failure of most suppliers in the apparel industry to make inventory carrying costs an explicit part of their decisionmaking process remains a significant impediment to enhanced profitability On the flip side the performance results presented in Chapter indicate that moving toward this more sophisticated method of handling production decisions can yield significant competitive advantagesCase Multiple Plants and Production PlanningOf course a firm that relies on multiple production plants has a more complex problem than the example just presented Not only must it set inventory levels and schedule production for each product but it must choose which products to assemble in each plant In many cases the choice is between a more expensive plantprobably located close to the marketthat provides shorter lead times and a more distant supplier that takes longer to make items but does so at a lower unit cost Under the traditional retailing system suppliers filled an order by carrying out assembly in the least costly plant as long as its quality was adequate for the market for which the product was destined In a lean retailing world however factors other than the direct costs of assembly and transportation need to be consideredCaught between lean retailers need for immediate replenishment and the high risk of carrying inventory for products with uncertain demand a manufacturer today must go beyond traditional direct costs and also include manufacturing lead times and inventory carrying costs in its sourcing equation Most production managers instinctively believe that having at least some manufacturing capability close to the market adds value to the company but expressing that value in dollars and cents and making specific allocations of products to plants are difficultManufacturerswhether of suits CDs office products or pastagenerally classify products in terms of product lines Planning therefore is done for fall fashion lines jazz ensemble CDs yellow legal pads or fettuccine pasta products Even if this method of categorization is important from a marketing perspective it often glosses over what is in fact common to many products that seem different and different about products that seem the same Once again demand variability is key For our mens suit manufacturer the mens size regular coat may have less in common with the size regular coat in the same size and color than with a fashionable boys blazerTo set an optimal policy for a multiplant or multisource setting the first step is to determine the coefficient of variation for each SKU and then to arrange the SKUs into groups that have similar variations in weekly demand ie the same Cv Figuring out how to assign products to plants rests on two findings explored in this chapter First the previous case study suggests that SKUs with large demand variance high Cvs will require larger amounts of inventory than low variance SKUs to provide a high orderfulfillment rate to the retailer Second we argued earlier that reducing manufacturing lead times can lower the amount of inventory needed The combination of these factors suggests that high variance SKUs are the best candidates for a plant with short lead timesthe higher direct costs of production are balanced by the reduction in inventory carrying costs resulting from the shorter manufacturing lead timesThe TwoPlant ModelOur second case study is based on a prominent apparel manufacturer that acted as one of our research sites Here we will show how a decision tool can be used to make the transition from general intuition to specific decisions about which products to make in each plant and how to schedule the time and quantity of production for each product This analysis can help manufacturers allocate production among existing facilities It also illustrates what plant characteristics a closetomarket production facility must have to be competitive with lowcost offshore suppliers For this analysis we assume that that the two facilities already existthat is we do not evaluate the option of building a new plant or modifying an existing plant ie we are seeking a solution to a shortrun optimization problemA simple depiction of the production situation is presented in Figure Block diagrams represent this manufacturers plants and distribution center as well as the retail stores involved There are two production lines or plants in the quickline plant it costs more to produce an item of apparel but it does so more quickly than in the regularline plant The flow of goods is shown in solid lines and information flows are represented by broken lines Both plants are capable of making the same set of products We assume that once a week orders from all retail stores selling the product are received picked packed and shipped to the retailers from the manufacturers distribution center On receipt of the weekly orders production managers total the quantity of each SKU ordered and determine production needs to restore each SKUs distributioncenter inventory to its target level The total production quantity for each SKU is allocated between the two plants The cost to produce a unit and deliver it to the distribution center is known for each plant as well as the time it takesFor confidentiality reasons the actual costs and weekly sales volumes for our manufacturer are disguised however the cost numbers and sales volumes that appear in this case are reasonable numbers for say an upscale dressshirt manufacturer Lets assume that we have a single style of dress shirt and that the shirt can be made in one of two plants In the plant with the regular production line the average direct cost of producing one shirt is in materials costs including all buttons thread and lining material plus in labor and transportation costs including direct labor at the plant level transportation costs for fabric and other supplies shipped to the sewing plant the cost of transporting finished goods to the manufacturers distribution center any customs fees or insurance associated with transportation and any other costs associated with producing an acceptable unit of finished goods The other plant the quickline plant has production costs that are percent higher than for the regular line but the manufacturing lead time from the time a production order is placed until a shirt is available in finished goods inventory is two weeks compared to eleven weeks for the plant with the regular lineThe question a manager faces in this situation can be stated as follows For which dress shirts is it more profitable to pay per shirt materials plus production costs but have a twoweek production lead time rather than with an elevenweek lead timeIf this case involved traditional production strategies in the apparel industry there would be no problem to study Managers would just decide to make all these dress shirts in the regular plant because its unit production cost is lower But in the world of lean retailing the decision becomes more complicated Now the unit wholesale selling price assumed to be a shirt is relevant to the decision because managers must weigh the cost of carrying shirts in inventory with the foregone revenue if they stock out of shirts in the distribution centerIn addition these managers need to know weekly demand variation as well as average weekly demand for each SKU In this case we assume that total weekly demand for all of our SKUs averages shirts a week We classify the SKUs into three categories those with high demand averaging units a week and low demand variation Cv those with medium demand averaging units a week and medium demand variation Cv and those with low demand averaging units a week and high demand variation Cv These particular volumes and Cvs were chosen based on the values shown in Figure page Finally to allocate production appropriately managers need to know the inventory carrying cost for carrying workinprocess and finished goods inventory The inventory carrying cost should reflect not only the cost of capital tied up in inventory but also the risk of holding that inventory One indicator of risk is the cost of markdowns manufacturers must make to clear inventory that retailers are not willing to purchase at full wholesale priceif at all For example the HCTAR survey found that an average apparel business unit discounted its products to retailers by percent in Determining Optimal AllocationsNext the manufacturer must determine what percentage of its total capacity should be allocated to the quick line we call this percentage the quickline capacity ratio with the remainder allocated to the regular line Once this decision is made specific SKUs must be allocated between the two plants on a weekly basis As in the first case study we assume that the retailer places an order every Sunday night and that the order must be filled during that weekWe have developed a software package that solves this problem by using computer simulations of the weekly demand and production that determine the consequences of different quickline capacity ratios and production scheduling policies for the manufacturers inventory and service levels orderfulfillment rate to the retailer For a given quickline capacity ratio the computer program searches for a target inventory level for each SKU and finds the values of the target inventory for each group of SKUs that maximizes profit The number of computer searches necessary is very large but with a fast desktop computer and by using special search reduction techniques the computations can be carried out in just hoursThe results of a search for the maximum profit in this twoplant case appear in Figure page which shows how the quickline ratio increases as the inventory carrying costs increase As we would expect if the cost of carrying inventory is very low the quick line is not used that is the quickline capacity ratio equals zero As inventory costs rise the percent of units allocated to the quick line increases eventually when the annual inventory carrying cost approaches percent the ratio equals onethat is all the production is allocated to the shortcycle plant With higher values of inventory carrying costs it is more profitable to shift more production to the quickline plant to allow reduction in workinprocess and finished goods inventoryThe major point here is that inventory carrying cost is a critical variable in making such plant capacity decisions A percent annual inventory carrying cost amounts to approximately percent a month For the longcycle plant workinprocess and finished goods inventory will cover about sixteen weeks on average before the unit is sold At percent a month this results in an inventory carrying charge of just percent of the cost to assemble plus materials This percent charge against materials and production should be compared with the percent of wholesale selling cost our survey reported as the average markdown needed to clear inventoriesFigure shows the full relationship between inventory carrying costs lead times and the quickline production ratio Again our earlier intuition is confirmed The decreasing lead time of the quickline plant makes it competitive at a lower inventory carrying cost The shortcycle plant becomes more competitive for two reasons there is less workinprocess and the finished goods inventory level necessary to satisfy retail demand for each SKU is less because the shortcycle plant can respond to actual demand more quicklyIn this figure the cycle time of the slower plant has been set at eleven weeks the shortcycle line can make our products with three different timesnamely two three or four weeks In this case the cycle time for the longcycle plant represents the number of weeks typical for offshore production Note that some outsourcing of production for fashion items is done in Pacific Rim countries and flown directly to distribution centers in the United States For example executives at The Limited have often claimed that its firm can produce an item offshore in a thousand hoursor just six weeksusing airfreight delivery to its center in Columbus Ohio But most firms that use foreign plants take longer which is why we have chosen eleven weeks as the cycle time of the slower production line Figure shows the curves for the various lead times listed in the legend on the righthand sideBoth components of total inventory workinprocess and finished goods decrease as the most profitable production shifts to the shortcycle plant Less finished goods inventory is required because finished goods can be rapidly replenished after a peak selling weekTherefore the amount of finished goods in the manufacturers distribution center needed to satisfy weekly demand for all SKUs depends on the cycle times of the plants supplying finished product and what fraction of production is made in each plant In the singlebreasted coat example of the previous section there was only one plant involved which made the most profitable target inventory level a single number for each SKU Increased profit came from missing fewer sales by being in stock a higher percentage of the time In the second case the finished goods in the distribution center are generally a blend of the output of two plants and the target inventory level varies with the quickline capacity ratio Most important when a manufacturer considers two sourcing options the one that offers the lowest direct cost is not always the most profitableThe Manufacturers Dilemma in a Lean WorldThis chapter shows that suppliers must take additional dimensions into consideration when they make decisions about sourcing To maximize profits a firm must consider the complete set of benefits and costs of production decisions The disadvantage of lower cost slow production today is that it is necessary to risk large inventories to provide reasonable levels of service to retailers The omission of such costs from sourcing decisionsas well as the failure to consider the benefits a supplier gains by being in stock on certain itemswill reduce a manufacturers profitability as well as its ultimate ability to competeThis dilemma in a lean retailing world is summarized in Figure Exactly how a manager divides production between plants with different production costs and cycle times depends on the details of the situation such as those presented in the cases above However at least one general rule emerges from the cases we have studied The cycle time of a fast production facility can be no more than a week or two Needless to say a local more expensive production line with long cycle times cannot compete with slower lowcost producers even when allowances are made for late deliveries markdowns and the like But as Figure suggests a manufacturer can pay somewhat more to make certain unitsthose with high weekly variation in salesin quick production lines and still reap a better return than it would by making all of the product in a less expensive slower plantBalancing these production alternatives clearly has implications for foreign competition and the current transformation of the US apparel industry It also requires changes in internal processes including manufacturing innovations and the sophisticated computer tools necessary to do this kind of production planning Although many US apparelmakers are only beginning to incorporate these changes into their operations lean retailing practices will continue to push suppliers in this directionThe next two chapters examine apparel operations starting with a look at the use of information technologies and automation equipment in the preassembly stages of garmentmaking Chapter and then the sewing room Chapter Chapter considers how new human resource practices that allow for shortcycle production in concert with the use of information technology can positively affect the performance of suppliers The late Joseph Gerber founder of Gerber Garment Technology Company in Tolland Connecticut invented automated fabric cutting and introduced it to the market in This innovative company went on to create a new industry in automaticcutting equipment By the late s Gerber Garment Technology was supplying the automotive and apparel industries with its GERBERcutter allowing firms to cut cloth and nonwoven material more effectively The Gerber system first made it possible for a computer to guide the cutting knife anywhere on the cutting table Gerbers automaticcutting equipment as well as that of several other international competitors has continued to improve cloth from a single ply to layers up to six inches thick can now be cut quickly and accuratelyGerber is also a major worldwide supplier of information systems for the sewing products industries Its Product Data Management software provides users with all the information about an apparel product including design patterns markers sewing instructions and assembly costs This single software package can be made available through an inhouse local area network or the World Wide Web Computer data systems like this have enormous potential for the apparel industry Privatelabel apparel for US department and specialty stores for instance is generally designed in this country and produced by domestic contractors or overseas Regardless of geographic location it is always difficult for a contractor to know if it has the latest information on sewing patterns and other construction details But via a network that allows contractors access manufacturers headquarters can make sure that the information available is the most recent and complete In addition video instructions which do not rely on spoken language can demonstrate to foreign contractors what is acceptable and what is notIn previous chapters we have described the impact of crucial information technologies such as the use of bar code scanning and electronic data interchange on the retailappareltextile channel The ability to transmit order information in unambiguous electronic forms between retailers and apparel manufacturers along with the possibility of sharing pointofsales information allow these manufacturers to understand in real time what is happening in the marketplace It is then up to the manufacturer to use this information in product design and production planning Indeed for many apparel firms speed in the market now means using modern computer tools that make the process of creating a piece of clothingfrom conceptual design to fabric cutting to sewingsmooth and efficient From the first use of computerassisted pattern layout in the s computers and specialized information technologies have spread widely in the industry Such systems have the potential to develop patterns and color fabrics adapt apparel patterns for custommade suits shirts pants and other garments and evaluate production sourcing alternatives to maximize profit while allowing for demand uncertaintyYet not every aspect of apparel production depends on new technologies in fact automated sewing processes and the use of robots on the apparel shop floor have not turned out to be profitable or effective People do a better job than computers of adjusting fabric alignment through sewing machines and compensating for prior sewing and cutting errors As a result the marginal costs for human sewing operators are lower than those of the complex robotic systems needed to guide sewing of limp fabric in most operationsIn discussing apparel manufacturing it is important to make a distinction between preassembly of garmentsdesign markermaking spreading cutting and bundling operations that are the focus of this chapterand garment assembly the subject of the next chapter Most of the innovations in production and information technology are taking place in preassembly processes which can be more readily automated Although changes in how managers orchestrate production flow through the sewing room are starting to make a difference shifts in the practices of shopfloor workers have more to do with new human resource policies than equipmentAs most observers of the apparel industry know contracting out the assembly of garments has become common for American manufacturers although the use of contracting differs between the mens and womens industry Mens clothing has generally been made in long production runs with only small variations among styles in a given year and relatively little change from year to year This has allowed mens clothing manufacturers to capture the benefits of their own highly efficient sewing rooms through long production runs Womens clothing is characterized by great diversity in styles and short production runs Small contractors sewing shops are the norm for most womens apparel The use of contractors has grown at the international level in the s and sWe will examine some of the complex issues related to international sourcing in Chapter But we want to stress here that todays apparel supplier usually does not produce all of its own garments from start to finish Apparel manufacturing can involve many contractors and subcontractors creating a complex web of supplier relationships Jobberssuppliers that may contract out every aspect of clothing production except for designrepresent one extreme Companies like Liz Claiborne and MAST Industries are essentially current versions although their operations are much larger than those of jobbers in the pastMany USbased apparel firms not to mention the apparel union have long recognized that producing higher quality garments may be the best means for competing against lowcost foreign labor One way to increase quality is to control fabric purchasing markermaking spreading cutting and parts preparation in a central facility The manufacturer can then transport the cut parts for assembly to sewing rooms which may be either local or out of the country In fact HCTARs survey indicates that the average cutting room services sewing rooms Quality assembly of garments from pieces of material cut according to a particular pattern involves operations that can be carried out almost anywhere in the world Whether a unit of apparel is assembled in China or the United States the overall process is quite similar The differences from country to country remain in the detailsprincipally in the layout of the pattern on the cloth and in cutting the patternsFor instance the highend design of a womens jacket made from ayard cashmere plaid fabric can still be of very poor quality if the plaids do not match on the lapels the inseams of the sleeves or along the seam joining the back panels Pattern layout may not seem important at first until one sees a plaid mismatch when this jacket is buttoned A very small amount of plaid mismatch in cutting can be overcome by a skilled sewing operator but the essential step in achieving a quality product is to make the pattern parts correctly This chapter describes the various steps involved before a garment is sewn focusing on the technical innovations that are having the greatest impact Before looking at preassembly operations in apparelmaking however we will examine the very beginning of the processgarment design and the creation of a patternThe First Step Apparel Design and PatternsWhen most people think of apparel design they see fashion designers and models on runways Yet the vast majority of design in the apparel industry has little to do with the way clothing is created in the highfashion world Often apparel design and patternmaking are done by department stores privatelabel offices and small manufacturers in addition to major firms The name designers generally create fashion directions and the next tier of designers fill out the new directions into many levels and for many items of apparel Department stores also have designers at headquarters who prepare designs and patterns for their privatelabel collectionAlthough many apparel manufacturers do have inhouse designers most of the work of garment design comes in adjusting previous patterns or small elements of existing garmentssay the trim or the fabricand is more a matter of technical creation than a flight of fancy Consider the expansion of basic and fashionbasic garments in the US market For Tshirts sweatpants and different types of jeans the design elements that change annually may only amount to a change of color fit of the jeans or the addition of a pocket to sweatpantsTraditionally a new apparel design was created by asking the designerartist to make a watercolor sketch If the fabric was to have a pattern there might also be a closeup colored sketch of it Many designs would be grouped together into a storyboard which was then presented to managers for final decisions Next the designs that passed this stage went through a technical design step in which details were added and patterns made After this step fabric might be cut and a sample made to see how it would look on a mannequin If the new garment was a blouse for example the designer might wish to see how it looked with skirts planned for the collection If the designer was not satisfied with the drape of the garment the fit or the pattern he or she might go back to square one Several iterations of these initial design steps could add weeks or months to the process before production beganAlthough some haute couture or highend apparel designers may still work in this manner each year more garments are designed using computer technology In our survey percent of the business units reported using ComputerAidedDesign CAD systems to prepare new products in Employing CAD was particularly common among the largest business units in our sample The use of modern design tools and information technology can collapse the design time so that managerial decisionmaking becomes the longest step in the processand even the time for that step can be shortened with information technology The new way allows the designer to work creatively with a computer pen or brush to outline the sketch which appears on a computer screen The computer can watercolor the sketch and produce the storyboard for presentation Once past the first steps these systems let designers drape fabric patterns on sketches or photographs of people on the computer screen For example sketches or photos can be draped with material of different colors and patterns The size of the pattern can be changed and the visual images compared to get a sense of their appeal And a colored inkjet printing of the pattern can be made on basic plain fabric to help identify and demonstrate the desired colors in future discussions with textile millsDesign changes can be implemented in minutes For example if the apparel item is a skirt the proposed material on the computer image can be changed with a few key strokes Prints can be scanned into the computer and used as the pattern for the visual image Entire collections can be created in a day with the selected materials draped on a sketched figure or actual photograph of a model The colors of the blouse can be changed with a few computer steps The color and texture of the rest of the garments in the photograph can be changed with equal ease Computerized design systems collapse the time needed to explore new design ideas into hours of work rather than the traditional work time of days or weeks The resulting visual images can be shared with other decisionmakers in the company wherever they might be without the need to wait until everyone is in town for a meeting Computer images can be viewed on the local area network or even put on the Internet in a secure formOther development applications allow designers to begin with an actual garment and make appropriate changes to achieve the desired design or construction modifications In this case designers pin the garment to a special design table A computer pen is used to outline a panel of the garment with a sequence of contact points The computer on command then connects the image of the points on its screen with a series of line segments that form the silhouette of the pattern piece Another computer command adds the seam allowance and after the desired modifications have been made a piece of the new design is created When all the individual pieces of the garment have been modified and entered into the computer system the final garment pattern is ready to be cut and sewn into a sample garment Numerically controlled fabric cutters are now available that can rapidly and accurately cut patterns from a single ply of cloth removing the usual obstacle to sample garmentmaking The cutting equipment is driven by the output of a patterngrading and markermaking programNote that this entire design sequence can take as little as part of a day yielding a sample garment hung on a mannequin Again the time it takes managers to reach a decision is what determines the length of this process However it may take months to produce a sample garment in a desired fabric simply because that fabric takes months to makeDesign information systems such as the Gerber Garment Technology software discussed above can also greatly affect how and when design changes are made Gerbers Web version of such a system WebPDM allows worldwide access to designated users with information stored on a single host server about relevant apparel products Naturally contractors for sewing assembly will not be allowed access to estimates of production costs and information about other suppliers however once a change is made in a garments design then everyone involved will have access to and can work from the identical information base The system can store design costing measurements and detailed construction information all in multiple languagesPreassembly MarkerMakingAn order to an apparel factorywhether from a retailer jobber or a manufacturer contracting out different stages of the workspecifies the total number of units to be made of a particular design with a given fabric and with a certain number of units in each size Because a retailer normally will have already seen a sample garment before placing an order the manufacturer therefore will have the pattern pieces for all sizes inhouse with coordinate outlines of the pieces on its computers The manufacturer might also have the patterns cut out from stiff fiberboard so that the individual pieces can be traced by hand onto a large sheet of paper But several preassembly processes have to be performed before the cloth can be cut The order must be broken down into groups of units to be worked on together Then all the pieces of the patterns must be laid out for the various units so that they can be cut at the same time The silhouette for each individual pattern piece is generally traced or imprinted on a sheet of paper which is called a marker Finally the cloth must be spread in as many layers of thickness as necessary to achieve the number of units requested or as many as can be properly cut at one timeEach piece of the pattern in a marker has a seam allowance added to the basic outline This allowance serves two purposes First the sewn seam must be made far enough in from the edge of the cloth so that it will not pull free of the cloth second the seam allowance provides a region into which small alignment notches can be cut The notches are the basic instruction to sewing operators regarding where the fabric pieces to be joined should match up or be aligned In a sense these notches visually encode the basic sewing instructions into each pattern piece of the garment This means that skilled sewing operators do not need to be able to read a language to follow instructions They can follow the general outline of assembly from supervisors or video demonstrationsBefore the pattern layout is made there is the assortment problem of determining which apparel sizes should be included in a given marker Because each roll of cloth has a particular width grouping different sizes together will result in varying percentages of cloth utilization for each width For example if one is laying out a marker of mens pants there are four large panels for each pair along with fourteen other small pieces like waistbands and trim Yet the four panels of a pair of fortyinch waist pants will not fit in the typical sixtyinchwide bolt of cloth To achieve the percent cloth utilization typical of this kind of production one needs to combine six pairs of pants into one marker An efficient marker will have larger sizes of pants balanced with smaller sizesA typical marker for mens pants is shown in Figure page At first glance it might appear that almost all of the cloth is used in the marker in fact only percent has been covered in the layout of individual pieces Given the basic shapes of the pants pieces it is unlikely that a substantial increase in marker efficiency can be achieved At best experience with different combinations of waist sizes and leg lengths for a given design allows a scheduler to aggregate the units to be made into groups of large and small sizes which means markermakers can achieve efficiencies near percent for casual pants Higher cloth utilization is possible with jeans but lower levels are normal for blouses jackets and intimate apparel see Figure Making a marker is a complicated task even with modern computer assistance Because fabric is generally the most expensive part of finished garments the skill of the markermaker is critical for achieving high cloth utilization and lower fabric costs Markermaking is easier with fewer pieces but with fewer pieces overall cloth utilization is generally lower A typical production pants marker is about inches long and inches wide This marker over feet long contains all of the individual pieces of the shell fabric that make up six different pairs of pants An operator with six months or more of experience with pants markers can take up to ninety minutes to achieve an efficiency of to percent Manipulation of the arrangement of these pieces whether on a computer screen or not is a timeconsuming task It resembles putting a jigsaw puzzle together except that the cloth pieces do not fit together exactly The separate pieces can be moved around on a computer screen by the normal drag and drop procedure but even this involves a complex mixture of trial and error and relies heavily on a markermakers experience A trial marker might leave the righthand end very uneven for example resulting in low utilization when the cloth is cut straight across the bolt in the standard guillotine cut Such a marker would not be acceptable for production A markermaker would have to reconstruct the layout to give it the appearance of those in Figures and Computer layout systems also improve the quality of the finished apparel by preventing markermakers from tilting the pieces by more than a predetermined amount typically three or four degrees These restrictions ensure that the weave of the cloth is aligned along the length of the garment After all stripes should be verticala quality feature of the final product determined when the marker is made not later in the process Such quality is difficult to achieve with hand layout and manual tracing of the silhouette onto the marker cloth When the layout is done by hand through tracing on a sheet of paper there is always a temptation for the operator to tilt a particular piece a bit more squeezing it into the marker or shrinking the silhouette of some of the pieces to get them all on the marker Subcontractors who might do cutting as well as sewing are provided with enough fabric to make the order Any fabric left after the order is completed is kept by the subcontractor providing an incentive to squeeze the pattern pieces more than a designer might wantWhen the computer screen layout is finished it is automatically printed fullsize on paper by large computerdriven printers The paper marker identifies each piece in the layout so that the cloth pieces for individual apparel items can be put together after the fabric is cut Computerassisted markermaking can offer large savings with basic garments like mens pants or womens intimate apparel which may be manufactured repeatedly over several years The same assortment of sizes might be needed many times in a month and the finished layout can be called up from computer memory and used over and over again provided the width of the fabric remains the same There are however small variations of fabric width from bolt to bolt and from one supplier to another If the cloth runs wide or narrow an efficient manufacturer would remake the marker to take advantage of the full width Variation of just a quarter inch in a sixtyinch width can yield a percent change in cloth utilizationPart of HCTARs research effort has resulted in new automatic markermaking software based on computational geometry techniques The software allows a manufacturer to take existing production markers and automatically compact the arrangement of pieces by translation or a combination of translation and allowable amounts of rotation It automatically adjusts for changes in fabric width by moving the pieces to the left and up or down to fill the available width most efficiently The more pieces in a marker the more effort required to make an efficient marker of a given width Therefore if the cloth of a given bolt of fabric is half an inch wider than the marker there is a tendency to cut the marker as is Yet some users of this software have been able to decrease the amount of cloth lost in this way by as much as percentThe pants marker shown in Figure was produced by this automatic layout software and yielded cloth utilization of percent The equivalent production marker made by the manufacturers highly skilled operator using a computer but without HCTARs software achieved a utilization of percent or just a little less than the fully automatic software system Sometimes a human operator can beat the automatic system by a small amount but the following example is typical The production marker for the intimate apparel item in Figure was initially laid out by a trained operator with percent utilization the HCTAR software compacted the marker and achieved cloth utilization of percent an improvement of percent Onethird of the wholesale price of apparel is typically fabric cost A percent savings in fabric over the entire production goes directly to the bottom line Such savings can add up to many millions of dollars for large manufacturersBased on our survey results about twothirds of the business units in generated markers by trained operators with computer assistance when the survey response is weighted by dollars of yearly sales however percent of the business units production came from computergenerated markers In contrast apparel operations in developing nations generally do not use computerized layout systems Markers are made by hand tracing pattern pieces onto sheets of paper from thick precut cardboard pattern elements The primary alignment tool is the meter stick for measuring distances from the edge It is not hard to imagine a tendency to allow a slight twist in individual pieces to achieve a closer fit between neighboring piecesThere are also stories of subcontractors in this country as well as overseas crumpling a marker up so that when it is laid out again it will be just a little smaller in width and lengtha trick to save a fraction of a percent from each piece The savings can add up for the contractor since the apparel manufacturer that supplied the cloth might not notice As far as final quality is concerned however such arrangements create the wrong incentiveanother reason why it may make more sense for USbased manufacturers to control all aspects of preassembly including markermaking and cuttingPreassembly SpreadingEvery meter of fabric destined for apparel production is normally inspected by the textile manufacturer As a part of this inspection and repair a detailed map is made that locates any remaining defects the minimum width of the bolt is measured along with the overall length of the unstretched material After final inspection the cloth is wound without tension on a roll for shipment But it is actually impossible to wind the fabric onto a roll without leaving some stresses in the cloth Variations in storage temperature and humidity also cause changes Indeed all the residual stresses in the cloth cause problems when it is spread on the manufacturers lay table prior to cuttingSpreading cloth out on a table in a way that leaves it flat but unstretched without tension in the cloth is more difficult than one would think To get the cloth flat without mechanical help two workers could hold the cloth by both ends and stretch it out flat then release just one end But the friction between the table and the cloth will leave this layer ply of cloth stretched just how much will depend on the amount of friction between the two Putting another ply on top the same way creates an additional problem The friction between the second ply and the first can create a wrinkle in the first ply When plies of cloth are piled higha foot or more is not unusualthere are often wrinkles in the plies after they are cut This is especially true for knit goods which are easily stretched and adhere well to neighboring plies in a stack of clothThe number of plies of cloth spread at one time depends on the fabric which in turn determines how many are cut at one time Thirty plies of denim might be cut together whereas a hundred to three hundred plies of mens dressshirt fabric might be cut at one time In contrast a mens dress suit might be cut from a single ply or from five or six plies of the same or different materialSpreading the cloth many plies thick without stressing the cloth is again one of the quality steps of getting ready to sew If the cloth has tension before it is cut then it will contract after it is cut into separate pattern pieces Because it is easy to stretch many fabrics by up to an inch in a yard one can imagine the amount of distortion possible in the final garment But technical innovations have aided the operators Stresses in the cloth on the lay table can be minimized with the help of mechanical spreading machines and such devices come in all sizes and costs The most elaborate allow an operator to ride the machine which holds the rolls of cloth so that it can feed the cloth onto the table at a speed that just matches the speed of the machine as it moves along rails fixed to the table Onboard computers compare the location of cloth defects with pattern pieces in the marker If the type of defect and its location are deemed unacceptable then the bolt of cloth is cut and a new ply started with enough overlap to ensure that all pattern pieces are whole and without defects In our sample business units used some type of automatic spreading for about percent of the volume of goods they shippedSimpler spreading machines have no onboard computer but they do unroll the bolt of cloth unstressed and properly aligned with the edge of the ply below However spreading is done it is important for the plies to lie directly on top of each other Misalignment of the edges can ruin many pattern pieces and the final garments for which they were intended Once a ply is laid down it is almost impossible to shift it because of the friction between the plies With simple spreading machines the operator must look for fabric defect indicators placed in the selvage by the textile manufacturerAfter the cloth is spread it is ready for the appropriate marker to be fit on top and fixed to the lay of fabric Sometimes staples are driven through the paper into the underlying cloth If the lay is made by hand then the cloth is generally cut directly by handguided electric knives that slice through the cloth on the table If computercontrolled cutting is used the lay of cloth is pulled onto the cutting table by an underlying paper sheet In either case the pattern pieces can now be cutPreassembly The Cutting RoomSince the early twentieth century the cost to a manufacturer of a cutters mistake has been much greater than one committed by a sewing machine operator Wrong stitching can be pulled out and a seam redone in the sewing room but a big mistake by a cutter can involve the loss of many yards of clothand cloth costs range from one or two dollars a yard for inexpensive fabrics to three hundred dollars for some cashmeres Even relatively small errors in cutting can degrade the final quality of garments If the fabric is defect free the marker efficient the lay flat and unstressed then everything else is up to the cutterSome magazine advertisements for upscale mens dress suits tout handcutting by experienced tailors Occasionally the ads include a drawing of a man with a large pair of scissors But cloth is rarely cut this way even when only one ply is cut at a time An eight or twelveinch pair of scissors is an unwieldy instrument difficult to guide within the th of an inch of the pattern outline It is even harder to accurately cut the notches used by sewing operators to align cut partsMost often an electrically driven vertical reciprocating knife is used to cut the fabric The vertical knife oscillates less than threequarters of an inch but can cut cloth plies a foot or more in thickness The knife and motor are supported above the base plate by a frame The frame also gives the cutter a place to grip the machine for handguided cutting The base plate is a smooth cap with a slit to contain the moving end of the knife The knives have builtin sharpeners that run a stone up and down the blade every few minutes In such a handcutting operation the operator guides the knife along the outlines on the paper marker fixed to the fabric lay One hand holds the marker on the lay the other guides the electric knife When a pattern piece is cut from the lay the cutter then makes the notch cuts indicated on the marker These slits should be about oneeighth of an inch cut into the threeeighthinch sewing margin around the pattern The chances are high of making the slit too deep or forgetting it entirely Computercontrolled cutting machines on the other hand do not forgetJoseph Gerber solved the major problem in cuttinghow to hold the cloth while the knife cuts through the materialby putting the entire lay on a vacuum table The fabric lay with the marker on top is covered with a thin sheet of clear plastic When the vacuum pump comes on five pounds of force per square foot push down on the fabric The thin plastic sheet effectively cuts off the flow of room air through the fabric The vacuum holds the cloth firmly and compresses the thickness of the lay typically by halfGerbers automaticcutting equipment holds the knife on a frame that spans the cutting table and moves back and forth along the table The location of the knife anywhere on the table can be precisely controlled by a computer allowing it to cut its way along the silhouette of the patterns Finally Gerbers equipment enabled the knife to slice through all the cloth without hitting the top of the vacuum table supporting the lay of cloth on a brush between the fabric and the inlets to the vacuum table The stiff bristles of the brush were made of plastic with flat tops similar in appearance to a flatheaded nail The flat tops supported the fabric The plastic bristles were stiff enough to support the fabric layer under the force of vacuum while remaining sufficiently flexible to deflect out of the path of the knifeThe most uptodate versions of automaticcutting equipment including the GERBERcutter are even more effective Cloth is cut by having the knife oscillate up and down while it moves along the silhouette of the apparel pieces in the marker The knife support tilts to keep the blade erect when going along curves Software can prevent lines from being cut twice it can control the touchy job of cutting the apex of wedgeshaped pieces by approaching the point from both sides of the wedge rather than attempting to cut around the tip The vacuum tables have also become smart One level of vacuum is maintained over the general lay area a higher level is arranged under the region being cut to keep the cloth fixedYet despite the obvious advantages of computercontrolled cutting only a minority of the business units in our survey percent were using this kind of equipment in Most continued to use manually guided electric knives to do their cutting including some of the largest business units in the sample Manufacturers have told us that handcutting with skilled cutters is as accurate as computercutting Small factory operations without sufficient volume to support two shifts of cutting claim that they cannot justify the capital cost of computer systemsThose that do have computer equipment say that the consistency of cutting was their primary reason for purchasing computerdriven cutting systems The computer cutter does not tire during the day nor forget to cut the notches and the operator of computercutting equipment does not need the skills of a manual operator As with many new technologies that have developed since the s adoption of innovative equipment is still occurring in fits and starts and depends on a given firms size and mix of products In the case of computercontrolled cutting however there appear to be longterm advantages for manufacturers especially those that produce large runs of basic or fashionbasic products Apparel producers providing garments with multiple dimensionsfor example mens shirts that are sized according to collar sleeve length and often torso lengthrequire much more consistent cutting than suppliers whose apparel is sold only in small medium and large sizesKnit material which is easily stretched poses other challenges for cutting Tubular knits are often cut in a diecutting press With most tube Tshirts for instance the diecutter serves the twin functions of pulling the knit material into the machine and centering it under the die before cutting The machine then presses the die down on the fabric cuts through the fabric and unloads the machine The centering operation is important because the diameter of a knit tube varies slightly along its length and it is necessary to reference cutting from the midline of the tube Some diecutting operations allow for a number of knit tubes to be centered placed on one another and then cutLike computercontrolled cutting equipment largecapacity knit diecutting presses are expensive machines they can cost up to and are generally found only in factories of the largest producers The die is a razorsharp steel outline of the desired item to be cut Like a cookie cutter it is pressed down on the fabric and if all is aligned a replica of the die is cut from the tube To change the size of the item to be cut the die must be removed and a new one installed The machines are massive in size because they must be rigid to achieve cutting along the entire silhouette Diecutters are much safer when fully automated but building computerized loading and unloading features into the machine adds cost Therefore such machines are used only where long production runs of a given size of Tshirt or sweatpants will allow a payback of their capital costs through roundtheclock or multishift operationsOne other technical innovation deserves mention here partly because it illustrates why the most sophisticated equipment is not always appropriate for factory operations Lasercutting of fabric remains a little used technique in the United States and abroad The HCTAR survey indicated percent usage among responding business units in and if the survey results are weighted by the dollar value of production then the use drops to only percent We have seen such equipment working in a production setting in a knit goods manufacturers facilities however we believe that its immediate potential use is limited for several reasons Lasercutting equipment must be totally enclosed to be safe for human operators A highenergy light beam vaporizes a very narrow path around the silhouette of the patterns to be cut The enclosure contains the vapors and conducts them to an exhaust outlet as well as prevents human access to the cutting region A laser beam can seriously harm humans and people may not notice the smalldiameter beams of light in an industrial environmentTwenty or more years ago when lasers were first used to cut cloth a mixture of polyester and wool as well as percent polyester cloth was common Attempts were then made to cut several plies of cloth at the same time The light beam did cut through the plies but it melted the polyester fibers at the sides of the burn and fused the edges of the cloth together No matter what is done the beam affects the edge of the cut With the lowerintensity laser beams of the past the bead of fused material at the edge of the cut formed a rough edge and was unpleasant to touch Some overedge sewing operations common with knit goods actually trim the edges of cloth just in front of the needle in these cases any fused material from the laser cutting could be trimmed away But if nothing else the temperature effects on fabric combined with the cost of installation appear to limit the use of this technology to those applications in which the connection between plies before sewing could be an advantageThe great advantage of lasercutting is speed Modern lasercutters developed both in this country and Japan leave the laser fixed in position and move the light beam around simply by computercontrolled tilting of the mirrors that guide the beam along the desired path With highpowered lasers the beam can be moved quickly and still cut through the cloth There may come a day when the demand for singleply cutting and the economics of continuous lasercutting will allow this technology to be more cost effective Until then it will not be widely used in the garment tradeBundling the PartsWhen cutting is completed the pieces are removed in stacks and arranged in bundles for sewing For many if not most applications each ply in a bundle is marked with a sticker to indicate the actual garment to which the piece belongs This can be an important step in mens dresssuit assembly Each suit is ideally made from pattern pieces cut from the same ply of cloth and the same region of material This is done to avoid cloth matching problems especially if the shade of the cloth varies along the roll The point is to make sure that even very slight shade variations will not be apparent in the final assembly It is also necessary to identify the individual pieces in order to assemble the correct pieces for a garment of a given size As we have already noted garments of various sizes are often grouped together on each ply of clothSome stacks of parts are further broken down into smaller bundles of parts so that sewing operators can use the same thread for everything in a bundle Suits and pants require thread colors that match or blend with the shell fabric and it is important to reduce the number of thread changes the sewing operator has to make A work ticket is attached to each bundle of cloth indicating the garment style size and all other necessary parameters The main tag generally has subtags or tickets that the sewing machine operator collects to indicate that a sewing operation has been completedThis final preassembly step and those that precede it affect the assembly operations that follow As we will see in Chapter work processes in the sewing room have been designed to minimize the direct labor content in a garment To ensure that sewing workers remain busy and operate at high productivity apparel manufacturers traditionally carry large readytosew cut goods in front of their sewing lines In business units carried a median of twentyfour hours three days worth of such goods However our sample also reveals that some manufacturers began to adjust to the new demands of lean retailing By the median dropped to ten hours reflecting their desire to reduce the amount of workinprocess at this beginning stage of apparel assemblyMass CustomizationThe percentage of the population wearing factorymade apparel has grown steadily since the nineteenth century Some still rely on custommade clothing especially those who have to go this route because of their size and shape or those with the money to afford custom tailoring Although many might like to have customized clothing few consider it a realistic option It is only recently that mass customization may make sense for both consumers and apparelmakersMass customization involves a number of preassembly innovations When somebody orders custommade clothing his or her measurements are taken by a fitter in a store and three to six weeks later the garment appears In this case how was the suit shirt pants or pair of jeans made Were all the preassembly steps followed or did an individual tailor cut the cloth and make the entire garment The answers depend on the garment as well as on just how custommade it really was Regardless of how customization was done in the past consumers paid more for the end product Mass customization however has the potential to make tailor fit at least somewhat less expensive as new systems combine features of the efficient factory system with attention to at least a few critical customer measurementsThere are two different approaches under way The first modifies an existing apparel design in a few dimensions to improve its fit for an individual customer Levi Strauss which is currently offering customfit jeans for women in some stores provides the best example of this kind of mass customization Many women have a difficult time finding a pair of jeans that fits to their satisfaction Buying jeans is based on both style and fit for many people this means trying on several different brands and finally making compromises Jeansmakers have tried to satisfy the majority by making many different styles and sizes but for some customers there still are not enough choices Fit for a given style involves at least four different measurements Obviously waist and hip measurements are important but where the waist should be also matters and once that is determined there is inseam lengthA customer for Levis custom jeans is asked to try on the style that comes closest to the fit she wants The store sales associate then takes the four key measurements waist hips where the waist should be and inseam These measurements along with the style of jeans and the type of fabric are sent to a sewing plant where they are cut sewn and then mailed to the customer Levis uses proprietary software to make these modifications but other software systems are commercially available for modifying standard patterns and producing a marker to guide fabric cuttingThe actual making of custom jeans or any other item of custom apparel is slightly more complicated than making an equivalent item under standard production conditions The pattern pieces for each individual pair of jeans must first be modified Then a unique marker must be created that combines different orders using the same fabric Under these conditions a marker will not be as efficient as the standard production markers shown in Figures and page because the amount of cloth that can be saved for a single ply does not justify the time required to reach high levels of cloth utilization Indeed fabriccutting costs are higher for custom clothing than for massproduced items simply because just one item of apparel is cut at a timeMass customization of this sort also means that a single garment must pass through the sewing room at a time Apparel assembly is described in the next chapter but for now it is enough to say that all the pieces for a custom garment must be kept together during assembly If the sewing room is making garments one at a time it is probably not using the progressive bundle system Instead items will be assembled by teams of a few workers who will do all the assembly operations Such a shortcycle production system adds to the cost of customized apparelYou cannot make a completely customized item of apparel with just four measurements The Levis process merely adjusts the pattern pieces of a basic style of jeans with these measurements If a customer wants more areas or features customized many more measurements are necessary Achieving consistent measurements presents a major problem because two trained fitters will generally come up with important differences in the body measurements of the same person No matter how the measurements are taken most people being measured in this way have a difficult time standing up straight and holding in their stomachsThe second approach to mass customization attempts to overcome some of these problems by optically scanning the customer with light beams in a private area of the store In this case the person needs to be dressed in appropriately tight form fitting but not form modifying athletic shorts and a top The computerprocessed results of such a scan are shown in Figure page with a sample of the extracted body dimensions in inches printed on the right side of the figure For reference some of the measurements are highlighted and presented as darkened lines on the processed imageThe optical system that produced this image was developed by TC and is now ready for commercial demonstration This system will probably cost and a demonstration in a shopping mall is currently under way When in place customers will be scanned at a central location in a mall They would then take their body measurements to any of several participating retailers who pass the information on to their apparel suppliers and have the clothing custommadeComputergenerated body measurements are just the first if most important step in achieving success in fit for customized apparel The measurements must still be transmitted to a CAD system that will automatically alter the pattern to conform to specific body measurements From that point the pattern must be laid out cut and sewn by a group of sewing specialistsThe technology now exists to do mass customization whether that involves a pair of jeans based on four measurements or a garment custommade from a whole body scan Five US firms including TC offer D scanners and there are at least two firms with systems that can adjust basic patterns to conform to individual body measurements Custom clothing may therefore be financially available to a wider audience in the future opening a new market in which domestic apparel manufacturers can compete The general public interest in the possibilities of mass customization is evidenced by a recent article in TheNew York Times describing the techniques and reporting that representatives of several apparel firms expressed interest in exploring the public willingness to pay for better fitting clothingFrom Preassembly to AssemblyMass customization represents an innovative combination of new technologies in information design markermaking and cutting For the short term its impact will be on a relatively small niche market However lean retailing and product proliferation place much more general pressure on suppliers to decrease time and cost per SKU associated with the design and preassembly steps we have describedIn many American apparel plants central spreading and cutting rooms abut the area of fabric inventory Finished goods distribution is often a part of the same complex Centralization of this kind makes financial sense because trucks that take out cut parts to a firms sewing rooms or contractors can return with finished goods for inventory Having spreading computercutting fusing and inspection in the same areas also allows teams of crosstrained workers to prepare the order for sewing finishing final inspection and packaging This is one place in apparel manufacturing where teamwork has been quite successful In many cases it has shortened the cycle time from order to ready for sewing by half In addition computercutting or diecutting makes the team less dependent on the skill of a manual cutter and allows all team members to operate automatedcutting equipmentThese centralized spreading and cutting facilities generally operate at least two shifts per day and in some large companies around the clock The equipment is capital intensive especially if computerized or diecutting machinery is used therefore plant managers try to keep these lines producing as much as possible We have visited a large knit goods manufacturer that combined final fabric finishing operations in the same building with cutting and initial automated sewing all of which operated around the clock Although automation of sewing operations is generally not cost effective these innovations have made some inroads in particular segments Tshirts which are consumed in the United States every year by the billions are a good example A commercially available machine can automatically make the sleeves of Tshirts This machine picks up cut material from a carousel at one end and delivers finished sleeves at the other One operator can tend to the needs of two such machines Yet because the investment per worker is several hundred thousand dollars it only makes sense if the equipment is used nearly continuouslySewing factories in contrast are not capital intensive and are rarely operated for more than one shift Because of this most expensive automation equipment is concentrated in preassembly drawing on multishift operations Markermaking fusing processes sleevemaking for Tshirts diecutting and computerdriven knifecutting fall into this automated getting ready to sew category As always in a world of lean retailing and rapid replenishment the need for faster production is what drives these capitalintensive technical innovations Because some US manufacturers have found that centralizing preassembly operations also improves the quality of products this may provide another edge for American apparelmakers in the futureOur survey indicates that the average length of time it takes to get a garment ready for sewing from issuing the order for a given marker to having the pieces cut and otherwise prepared is working days The cut parts are then sent to sewing areas or other factories If the sewing room is in the same building as the cutting room then cut goods are sent over many times a day If the sewing factory is far away then a shipment once a week is typical Reducing the time from placement of the order to cut goods in the sewing room requires decreasing both the time it takes to complete preassembly and the wait for delivery to the sewing room Indeed logistical considerations enter assembly well before garments are finally sewn together Time really is money in todays apparel industry a theme we will expand on in the next two chapters Forty years ago home economics courses in high schools across the country taught cooking nutrition and sewing to most schoolgirls The sewing machine in its polished wooden cabinet was an expensive and valued wedding gift Now the sewing machine like the typewriter is fast disappearing The typewriter is being replaced by the computer and the home sewing machine has become a small inexpensive portable unit stored in the closet and used for minor repairs and alterationsif it is used at all There are many reasons for this shift away from home sewing including the growing number of women in the labor force But perhaps the main reason is that production of factorysewn clothing has become increasingly cost effective It has taken away a timeconsuming and often wearying task from the round of daily chores providing consumers with a wide array of products and styles at reasonable prices The popularity of casualwear items like Tshirts and jeansquintessentially factorysewn garmentshas also shifted sewing from home to the factoryThe annual number of units of outerwear created in the United States has remained remarkably constant over the last several decades varying from units per capita in to units in while the number of production workers has continued to drop from in to in This employment decrease is associated with the impact of casual wear an increase in worker productivity and the significant import penetration in garments with high labor content Casual clothing is not only less expensive to purchase and maintain but also requires less labor to assembleWhether the apparel item is casual or formal the stitching in the garment must accomplish one or more of the following objectives The primary reason to sew of course is to join individual pattern pieces The second objective is to leave no raw edge of fabric to unravel This feature is sometimes combined with the joining operation as in the felled seaming on the inseam of jeans or the sleeve seam in mens dress shirts The felled seam was first used in work clothing because of its strength and has since migrated to other apparel items because of its visible stitch pattern Decorative stitching is the third objective of sewing In the felled seams of shirts and jeans for example the visible stitches might be of a color designed to decorate the garment No matter which stitch pattern is being used or which seaming operation carried out the sewing machine operator must guide one or more pieces of cloth together through the machine That is the basis of modern sewing operations in manufacturing facilitiesAs we have noted throughout the actual sewing of a garment may take place far away from its design the translation of that design into a pattern and the making of a marker of that pattern which is arranged on layers of fabric for cutting Consequently the assembly of that garment often involves sewing together pieces from prearranged bundles sent by the manufacturer In the contemporary world of contractors subcontractors and complicated sourcing decisions assembly is usually the step in the manufacturing process that is farmed out to lowercost firmsYet just because many US manufacturers rely on foreign contractors for a good portion of garment assembly it does not mean sewing in a factory requires little or no skill Only a very few sewing operations involve a machine that is fully automated in which the operators job comes down to stacking parts at one end of the sewing system and rethreading the machines if a thread breaks Todays factory sewing machine is generally dedicated to a single operation and most likely will be fitted with specialized fixtures in the area of the stitch plateto help guide the seaming a fixed distance from the fabric edge for example or fold the edge of the cloth under or with other attachments that feed elastic tape and so on into the seaming operation as needed More complicated sewing operations require the operator to guide differential stitching with more fabric in each top stitch than in the bottom one Regardless of which individual sewing operations are required the operator must be trained and given practice time to achieve a quality product at least at the standard production ratesThe time required for a new worker to achieve production standards while maintaining quality can range from days for the simplest operation to nearly a year for joining the sleeve to the body of a suit coat A few sewing operations are so demanding that some operators are never able to achieve the minimum acceptable production rate for them With different skill levels required for different operations it is not surprising that piece rates vary with the difficulty of the operation In this chapter we will describe what actually goes on in todays sewing roomthe machines used what operators do the flow of operationsand how sourcing decisions for replenishable products may affect assembly operations in the futureSewing Machines and Garment AssemblyThere are two major types of sewing machines used in garment assembly the lockstitch and the chainstitch machine Each type feeds in separate threads above and below the fabric and these two threads must be connected in some fashion to form a stitch Both have one top thread for each needle above the seam and one or more different threads on the bottom below the surface of the sewing table The primary difference between these sewing machines is in the way the two threads interactThe Lockstitch MachineAlmost all home machines are lockstitch machines The top thread comes from a spool or cone of thread above the machine and goes through many thread guides a thread tensioner a takeup arm and finally the needle The bottom thread is wound on a bobbin a small spool that is below the needle and the sewing surface To make a stitch the needle with the top thread is plunged through the plies of fabric and a loop of the top thread is formed below the surface of the stitch plate often called a throat plate The loop of top thread is passed over the bobbin and around its thread The takeup arm then pulls up the top thread to set a stitch The top and bottom threads are locked together by passing the loop of the top thread around the bobbinOne part of the art of sewing comes in adjusting the thread tension With a lockstitch machine when the needle withdraws from the cloth and the takeup arm pulls the top thread tight the stitch begins to be locked or set in place If the tension on the top and bottom thread is too high the seam puckers and the seam length becomes less than that of the cloth If the tension is too low the seam will be so loose one can see through it when holding up the joined pattern pieces Indeed a wellformed lockstitch is smooth and appears the same when viewed from either the top or bottom ply Note that even if a sewing machine is properly adjusted for sewing a particular weight and color of fabric it will generally need to be adjusted again if the fabric color changes because the mechanical properties of a given type of fabric can depend on the dye color used The lighter the fabric weight the more sensitive seam quality is to machine adjustments and thread tensions as well as to the ability of sewing operators to make necessary adjustmentsIn a factory setting lockstitch machines are used for the decorative stitching that is necessary whenever the undersurface of a garment piece will be seen during normal wear such as in the collar and cuffs of a dress shirt The primary disadvantage of this kind of machine is that the bobbin must be small enough so that it can pass through the top thread loop but it then quickly empties of thread When this happens sewing must be stopped and a newly loaded bobbin inserted to replace the empty one Since the bobbin is reached by sliding back the stitch plate if a bobbin runs out in the middle of an operation it might be necessary to rip the seam out from the beginning and start over Therefore sewing operators generally keep track of the number of items sewn on a bobbin and stop before the thread runs out If it were not for the limited thread capacity of the bobbin and the need for the operator to wind thread onto the bobbin the lockstitch would be more widely used in factory assembly operationsWhile mens dress shirts are normally sewn with white thread regardless of the fabric color most apparel items use a thread color to match or contrast in a decorative way with the cloth This means that after sewing a bundle of items of one color an operator must not only change the needle thread but also put in a new bobbin for each new color of fabric If an operator has a choice of thread color for the next lot to be sewn she will always choose the color of the last bundle Changing the type of fabric even if the thread color is the same generally demands adjustment of the thread tensions and other parts of the machine Long production runs of the same basic item of apparel with the same fabric allow sewing operators to make major machine settings once a day with only a few additional adjustments required throughout the shiftThe ChainStitch MachineThis machine overcomes the bobbin thread limitation and can operate at higher speeds but it does have disadvantages In this case there is no bobbin Below the sewing surface the lower thread is manipulated by a mechanical arm called a looper The looper inserts a loop of the bottom thread into a loop of the top thread that is created when the needle pierces through the fabric plies and begins to withdraw from the cloth The top thread is then pulled up by the takeup arm The top thread cannot be pulled through the cloth because it is held below the fabric by the inserted loop of the bottom thread The bottom thread is formed into a continuous sequence of very small loops by the looper arm Although the top and bottom threads are not interlocked as in the lockstitch machine the stitch is fixed in place and the seam has a bit more flexibilityBecause the bottom thread does not have to be encircled by the top thread the bottom thread can come from a large cone stored above the machine A new cone of looper thread contains miles of thread and generally does not have to be replaced more frequently than a few times during a shift The operator can glance up at the cones of both top and bottom threads and replace them before they run out in the middle of a seam The disadvantage of this kind of machine is that it makes seams that are not as secure as the lockstitch in addition the appearance of the seam from the top and bottom of the fabric is different If a stitch is skippedthe looper thread is not inserted or may not get caught in the loop of the top threadthen the resulting thread loop could pull the seam out if it were to catch on something Factory inspectors look for such flaws but they are hard to find because they end up on the inside of a garmentNevertheless the advantages of the chainstitch machine far outweigh its disadvantages A chainstitch seam is strong and can be produced more quickly than a lockstitch seam Most of the long seams in factorysewn apparel are made with a chainstitch machine or with variations of it The felled seam commonly used for the inseam of jeans comes from a twoneedle chainstitch machine Such stitching generally outlasts the fabric of jeans as one can see from looking at the holey knees of jeans worn by many teenagersOther Sewing MachinesA wide variety of specialized sewing machines are also used in factories There are machines with multiple needles and loopers that attach elastic waistbands to boxer shorts for example Knit fleece goods are commonly joined by a seaming operation called overedging in the factory and overlocking sewing in home use The overedge or overlocking machine automatically aligns the fabric by trimming off the edges of the plies to be joined just before the stitch is made At least one thread wraps around the edge of the fabric during the stitching process There are one two three four and fivethread overlocking or overedging machines each one designed to meet a given requirement of seam strength flexibility and security Overedge machines can run at more than stitches a minute At eight or ten stitches an inch it is possible to seam thirteen to sixteen or more inches a second In the factory however a sewing machines maximum speed is generally not what limits production it is the time it takes to set up the work on the machine and guide the fabric to the needle as the seam is being madeWhat the Sewing Operator DoesIn a typical apparel factory a sewing operator is actually sewing only onequarter of the time The operator must first select the work to be done put aside the tickets that indicate she performed the sewing appropriate for those bundles and should be paid at the specified rate for the job open the appropriate bundles and position the pieces to be joined on the sewing table in preparation for sewingIf the sewing machine is correctly threaded the operator then lifts the presser foota device that comes down on either side of the needle to hold the clothand if the needle is in the up position inserts the fabric Otherwise the operator turns the machine wheel to get the needle in the up position lowers the presser foot sews the beginning of the seam backstitches to lock the seam grabs the two plies of cloth near where the seam will end and guides the cloth through the sewing machine Usually she will backstitch at the seam end then cut the thread Some machines have an automatic threadtrimmer to do this step if not then the threads must be cut and the finished work put in an appropriate pile to be tied together when all the pieces of the bundle have been finishedMachinetending material placement and offloading operations are all considered part of a sewing operators job Although none of these operations actually involves sewing they do take time to complete and are taken into account when determining the piece rate and normal workload for an operation If a new sewing table or a new sewing machine with programmable features is added at a particular workstationthat is any device that reduces the time it takes to complete various tasksthen the allowable time and wage rate for that operation must be changedThese issues aside there is one other major task a sewing operator performs She must make the pieces of the pattern fit together at the end of the sewing process This is certainly not possible if there has been a big mistake in cutting but it is never easy even without serious cutting errors If two plies of flat cloth of identical length are placed on top of each other and sewn together then the ends of the two pieces will not line up without the intervention of a sewing operator The two ends of a thirtyinch leg seam on a pair of jeans for instance might be a quarter of an inch out of alignment unless the operator takes control During sewing the feeddog on the machinea part that comes up through two slots in the stitch plate and engages the bottom ply of clothwill pull the bottom ply under the presser foot and against the pull of the thread The top ply of cloth is carried along by the bottom ply hence one ply is stretched more than the otherThis simple fact of sewing makes it very difficult to automate the process In reality the two seam lines to be joined are rarely exactly the same length Cutting introduces differences from the top to the bottom of the layers of fabric No matter how good spreaders and cutters are preassembly operations are never perfect The sewing operator must overcome all these prior minor variations as well as the differences introduced by the sewing process and make the joining seam come out even at the end She accomplishes this magic by stretching the two plies differently First the plies are stretched to get the pattern notches in the two to align then the ends are pulled together causing them to align The operator uses the elasticity of the cloth to overcome minor errors in cutting and prior sewing Indeed most trained sewing operators see this defect correction simply as part of their jobThe Sewing RoomThe vast majority of workers in the apparel industry are involved in assembly This is illustrated in Table page for the mens and boys shirt industry In percent of all workers in this industry were classified as working in the sewing department percent were sewing machine operators Given the predominant share of workers in assembly organization of work in the sewing room has been the central focus of management attentionThe sewing rooms of most apparel factories are similar in overall appearance Apparel parts trim pieces buttons zippers and thread arrive at one end of the room and are separated for each operation or subassembly As the last chapter noted large apparel firms usually operate a central cutting room that provides cut parts to an average of five sewing plants About twothirds of the production volume of our surveyed business units did their markermaking spreading and cutting in a single location Most would deliver cut goods to sewing plants many times a week however when cutting is done hundreds of miles from the sewing plants weekly deliveries are the norm Trucks take fresh parts to the plants and return with finished goods for the distribution centerSewing rooms are generally arranged in rows of workers each seated at a machine doing one operation on a bundle of parts Traditionally the progressive bundle system assumed that maximum worker productivity could be achieved by breaking down the steps of assembly into a series of discrete operations Each sewing operator would be trained in the correct approach to one specific task Through repetition of the task and coaching by experts the operator would become very productive Although new work practices are evolving in the apparel industry many workers still specialize in one operation or at most two In fact long product runs in mens and unisex product lines such as jeans have made US sewing operators extremely efficientWorkers in most plants are paid on a piecerate basisthat is they are paid a fixed amount for each seam sewn correctly If a part must be reworked it is done on the operators own time This incentive system means that each operator needs to have workinprocess waiting if there is a machine breakdown or no work waiting then the operator will be paid at some average earnings rate during the waiting period But to avoid this there is always work waiting for example in a mens dressshirt factory there can be a days worth at each sewing station On the sewing room floor there are generally piles of items ready to be sewn or moved to the next assembly step The time it takes for a given item of apparel to pass through a plant is determined by the average hours of workinprocess before each operation and the total number of operations along the critical pathWork Flow in a PlantThe flow of operations through a typical mens dressshirt sewing factory is shown in Figure page The subassemblies for the collars backs fronts cuffs and sleeves might be on one side of a center aisle down the factory floor and the major assembly steps on the other side The factory manager needs to keep track of the flow of items through the plant to assure that the subassemblies such as the sleeves are ready to join the shirt A given shirt must have a specified collar size and a given sleeve length Clearly the fabric color and style must also match If the cut bundles are sent to the factory once a week this manager might then put that weeks bundles into carts identified by a flag flying the color for that week Note that the work in a shirt plant is generally grouped into production lots of shirts if the progressive bundle system is used Shirts are normally counted by the dozen so a production lot comes to dozenEach day the manager looks over the factory floor to see if any carts with a particular flag color are falling behind the others of that group Delays in product flow can result from machine problems worker absence or if priority is given to special orders In some plants the carts may contain up to a days worth of work Although this may appear to be a crude way of keeping track of the work flow it is simple and generally effective Still work almost never progresses in perfect lockstep through a factory Finding the correct parts for a shirt can often involve a hunt through the plant For example a worker might accidentally leave a bundle of unfinished work in the cart when it goes back to be loaded again Because a worker may have a days work in the carts in front of her it is easy to see how individual bundles of parts can be misplacedwhich in turn will hold up the assembly of some SKUs Partially finished shirts and shirt subassemblies will then be in a number of places in the factoryThis shirt factory employs workers If the shirt in question is rated to require twelve minutes to assemble such as the one in the figure a fortyhour work week will produce dozen shirts when the factory is operating at standard efficiency Of course many plants may fall below the standard and take longer than twelve minutes to make that shirt A typical time for a shirt to go through the plant is four weeks which means the plant will have dozen shirts as workinprocess WIP The forty operations indicated in the figure may require only twelve minutes if the operators are working at percent efficiency but any given shirt still takes twenty working days to pass through the plant To shorten the time significantly the workinprocess in front of each of the twenty operations listed as part of the critical path would have to be reduced from a day to just several hours Not all the forty different operations are sequential the parts assembly goes on in parallel but the final assembly involves a series of eleven operations that require all the subassemblies to be completed and ready to be mated with the correct partsNeedless to say reduction of throughput time is not a simple task Some of the forty operations require very little time others are much longer Hemming the top of a shirt pocket is a short operation for example but it takes longer to attach the pocket and longer still if stripes must be matched If there is one operator for the short operation then there will have to be several operators for the longer one just to keep the production line in balance If any one of the several operators speeds up or slows down the line becomes unbalanced If the imbalance lasts for more than an hour or so the factory manager would have to take corrective action A utility operator skilled in several operations might be brought over from another area to move work past the slow sewing station Clearly it is easier for the manager to keep all operators supplied with work especially since in most cases the workinprocess for each operator is large The large buffers are designed so that natural daily variations in work rhythm do not cause a major disruption In fact a production line is probably never in perfect balance If it were when even one worker in the plant changed her pace the line would drift out of balanceAs work progresses through a typical sewing plant it is also common for a special order to disrupt the flow Even if the special order does not require a thread change as with most dress shirts someone will have to move the order to the front of the queue at each sewing station and combine the parts for final assemblyWe have visited a topoftheline mens suit plant in Sweden where a special order would go through the plant in four working days rather than the normal six weeks just by allowing the work to go to the head of the work buffer at each sewing station In this suit plant work was moved from one station to the next by a Unit Production System UPS A UPS is a mechanical overhead transport system that moves a unit of clothing from one work station to the next The mechanical device generally carries all parts of the finished garment After a sewing operator finishes one step the carrier is sent on its way to the next There is a finite mechanical buffer area before each operator when the buffer fills the next unit is automatically sent to another operator who does the same operationWith a UPS delivery system factory throughput time can be dramatically reduced But the cost required to install such a system is steep running to or more per workstation The high cost and lack of productionfloor flexibility after the mechanical conveyers are installed have limited the number of factories adopting these systems In only percent of the output of our surveyed business units was assembled using UPS A competing approach to reducing plant throughput time involves teambased sewing or modular production which we will discuss at length in the next chapter In that case groups of sewing operators are trained in more than one assembly operation Workers move from one sewing station to another guiding the workinprocess through the plantThe assembly of most items of apparel follows the work flow sketched here Subassemblies are manufactured in small lines and join the critical path at the appropriate point But while a Tshirt for example might include sleeves made in the cutting room its collar might be inserted the sleeves attached and the garment finished in a sewing room far removed from the cutting room A suit manufacturer might cut the cloth for the suit in one plant ship the coat parts to another and ship the pants parts to yet another plant in another state Eventually regardless of where particular operations are carried out the finished garments return to a central distribution center to be shipped to customers In the case of the suit manufacturer with plants in different locations each individual suit is made from shell fabric cut from the same roll and generally the same ply of cloth on the lay table Matching the coats pants and vests is carried out in a special section of the distribution center The items are then stored in a way that makes them easy to pick for an order about to be shippedThe Costs of AssemblyThe investment per worker in a sewing room is quite modest A simple new commercial sewing machine may cost to but a rebuilt machine can run as low as five hundred dollars and still provide a good dozen years of production The average annual capital investment in sewing machines and attachments per operator in our survey was in dollars Some of the machines in an American mens dressshirt plant like the one previously described will cost or more but such automated sewing systems are rare As we have already noted the general requirement for return on investment forces expensive capital equipment to be operated under more than singleshift conditions unless it is essential to produce a given item The automated sewing systems that create the closely spaced regular stitch patterns used as decorative top stitching on mens dress shirts collars cuffs and pockets are examples of expensive machines operated for a single shiftBecause assembly operations are driven more by labor costs than capitalintensive equipment a typical American sewing factory operates just a single shift a day with an average of about thirtyseven hours of work per week On the mens side of the industry factories of up to several hundred workers are common but smaller loft shops are typical for womens apparel Factories are located where the workforce lives And the infrastructure needed to support a sewing room is relatively modest Power in the form of electricity waterespecially if items like jeans are to be washedand a phone are about all that is required In some developing countries workers are brought to the factories which are generally located at the outer reaches of the local industrial infrastructure These workers often live in dormitories on the factory compound for a period of a year before returning to their villages or moving into the city Similar worker dormitory arrangements were part of the mens suit industry in Japan as recently as fifteen years agoApparel Assembly and the Demands of Rapid ReplenishmentThe traditional system of apparel assembly was designed to minimize the direct labor costs of assembly not production throughput time The progressive bundle system with up to a days WIP waiting for each sewing operator was an efficient way of operating when the costs of carrying mountains of WIP did not enter into production costs Generally under this system of apparel assembly all production was made to fill an actual order The risk of inventory was carried by the retailer who placed the order so apparel operators carried large WIP in for our sample an average of weeks worthBut under rapid replenishment arrangements the inventory risk is now assumed by the apparel manufacturer consequently assembly time is now very important As shown in the cases studied in Chapter productioncycle time and inventory carrying costs are two crucial parameters in making rapid replenishment sourcing decisions When the assembly cycle time is reduced both the WIP and finished goods inventory levels necessary to meet a given rapid replenishment demand go downThe possibility of mass customization for some apparel items presents another market opportunity that demands shortcycle production If a retail customer pays a premium for a custom pair of jeans dress shirt or suit that customer will expect the item to be delivered to her home within days not weeks or months We are a nation of lastminute shoppers and mass customization will have to compete against overnight delivery of apparel items with less than perfect fit from a specialty catalog company Speed of delivery has increasingly become part of the competitive equationThere are a number of ways to organize apparel assembly to minimize cycle time One way is to use a UPS assembly process Another involves reorganizing the workers themselves through a team of sewing operators responsible for the entire critical path of assembly In this case sewing operators achieve productionline balance by moving from one workstation to another advancing the work smoothly through the line As in life there are few if any absolutes in methods of apparel assembly Each method of organizing production has advantages and problems associated with it Chapter takes up these issues in detail In my three decades of teaching university courses in child development I have come to know thousands of students many of whom were parents or who became parents soon after completing my class I also served on boards of directors and advisory committees for childcare centers preschools elementary schools and parent organizations And my research continually drew me into classrooms where for countless hours I observed and recorded preschool and schoolage childrens activities social interactions and solitary behaviors in hopes of answering central questions about how they learnAs a byproduct of those experiences parents repeatedly approached me with concerns about how to foster their childs development in the early years Their fervent questions at times riddled with doubt and anxiety revealed that creating optimum learning environments for young children at homeand ensuring their access to developmentenhancing experiences in child care preschool and schoolhave become mounting parental challenges Consider the following problematic situations that parents recently raised with meBob and Sharon parents of a yearold Our daughter Lydia could recite her ABCs and count from to by age When we looked for a preschool many programs appeared to do little more than let children play so we chose one with lots of emphasis on academics To me Lydias preschool seems like great preparation for kindergarten and rst grade but each morning Lydia hates to go Why is Lydia whos always been an upbeat curious child so unhappyAngela mother of a yearold and yearold My husband and I have demanding careers and need to bring work home in the evenings Ive read that its the quality of time we spend with our children thats important not the quantity We try hard to give Victor and Jeannine our undivided attention but theyre often whiny demanding and quarrelsome Many times we end up sending them to their rooms or letting them watch TV just to get some peace after a long day Whats the best way to create quality parentchild timeTalia mother of a yearold My son Anselmo a rst grader constantly asks us to help him with his homework His father rmly insists that he do it by himself Anselmo tries but he gets so frustrated and upset that I move in and help even in the face of opposition from his dad By that time Anselmo is on such a short string that I do most of the assignment for him Should we be helping Anselmo with his homework and if so howNoah and Suzanne parents of a yearold When our parents were raising us they seemed condent of their power and inuence Recently we read that how children turn out is mostly written in their genes theres little we as parents can do about it Does parenting really matterbaffled bewildered parentsDespite being well educated intent on doing whats best for their children and enlightened by a vast literature of childrearing advice many American parents appear uneasy and unsure of their roles at best baed and bewildered at worst As the above sampling of concerns reveals todays parents are not just worried about major transitions and traumas such as the impact of marital breakup or community violence They agonize over commonplace recurrent everyday situationswhether intensive preschool academic tutoring is crucial for later success in school the meaning of quality time with children and whether and how to help their child with homework At an even more fundamental level contemporary parents have begun to doubt their own ecacy in their childrens development Why is this soThe reasons I believe are twofold First rapid societal changes have complicated parents task making child rearing more challenging than in previous generations Second information about child development disseminated to parents is increasingly voluminous but at the same time contradictory It fails to oer a clear consistent vision of good child rearing to guide daily decision making and practice Lets take a closer look at these sources of parental frustration and confusion Societal ChangesOver the past three decades external forces impinging on the family have transformed parents and therefore childrens lives Overall parents complain that they have less free time to spend with their children Witness a survey of a large representative sample of American workers nearly percent of whom expressed the feeling that the demands of their jobs left them with no time for family Compounding their worries employed parents must out of necessity turn over many hours of child rearing to other adults Yet once their children are beyond their grasp they are hardly o the hook Conscientious parents face an added responsibility monitoring their childs whereabouts and activities verifying from a distance that their youngster is physically safe emotionally contented and constructively engaged Although many societal conditions heighten parents struggle to rear psychologically healthy children two are especially pernicious aecting even parents who manage to escape the trials and tribulations of divorce single parenthood stepchildren serious nancial worries and other family stresses The rst is the dire shortage of acceptable childcare options in the United States the second is the parental dilemma of never enough time In view of these diculties it is little wonder that so many American parents express a sense of powerlessness and inadequacy when it comes to aecting their childrens development the problem of child careIn percent of mothers with preschool children were in the labor force a gure that increased more than twofold to percent by An obvious solution to reconciling parents employment needs with young childrens rearing needs is to make highquality nonparental care with characteristics known to promote healthy psychological development widely available and aordable In Australia and Western Europe child care is nationally regulated and liberally funded to ensure that it conforms to standards veried by research to foster childrens learning social competence and emotional security Without a nationally regulated and generously subsidized childcare system formal child care in the United States is in much shorter supply and considerably more costly for parents than it is in other industrialized nations And as our discussion in Chapter will reveal on the whole the quality of American child carewhether centerbased or homebasedis mediocre to abysmal Indeed so widespread is poorquality child care in the United States that Americans have acclimated to it In a recent survey of parents whose children were enrolled in several hundred randomly chosen childcare centers across four states over percent believed that their preschoolers experiences were far better than experts in early childhood development judged those experiences to be Parents seemed unable to distinguish good from substandard care the time bindLike many parents Angela who raised the question of quality time complains of being torn in many directions Often she leaves work in a hurry in the late afternoon to pick up Victor and Jeannine from child care dashes to Victors tumbling class or Jeannines piano lesson then stops at the grocery store to pick up something for dinner When Angela and her husband Tom walk through their front door they typically head to the phone or fax machine to take care of unnished work while trying to quell Victor and Jeannines hunger and irritability with a frozen dinner popped into the microwave and unlimited access to the TV set Caught in a ceaseless sprint to reconcile job marriage and parenting Angela and Tom feel drained at the end of the daytoo tired to grant their children more than or minutes of focused time When Victor and Jeannine do get their parents undivided attention they are argumentative and unruly compounding their parents fatigue and impatience Angela and Tom represent a growing number of American parents who try to pencil children into busy schedules much like a business appointment They love their children but they also love and need their work for personal and nancial reasons Hence they nd themselves in a juggling act between the two with work usually winning out Tomorrow will be another day for the kids they rationalize but a business deal or a professional achievement if not capitalized on at the moment may evaporate Their logic dovetails with the concept of quality time for children In its commonly accepted meaning quality time refers to an intense but brief contact The term is a ready salve for the consciences of conicted parents who squeeze in a few moments with their children catchascatchcan yet sense deep down that they are robbing their youngstersand themselvesof something vitalThe expression quality time dates back to the s a decade that witnessed the largest rise in womens participation in the labor force during this century The notion was bolstered by observational studies of parentchild interaction In these investigations some parents exchanged positive emotional signals with and verbally stimulated their infants and read to and conversed with their preschoolers Other parents spent time with their children but were not actively engaged with them Time and time again children of the first set of parents developed more favorably cognitively and socially than did children of the second set of parentsA close look at the research reveals that children who fared well experienced eective interaction over an extended period In studies following children from infancy into childhood and adolescence early brief episodes of parental stimulation and sensitivity did not result in more competent children Instead positive supportive parenting that endured even when it marked a change from an early period of parental retreat or negative interaction was linked to favorable child development including persistence in problem solving high selfesteem socially skilled behavior closer friendships and better peer relationships In sum highquality involvement with children requires a certain quantity of timeactually a great deal as Ill argue in this bookIn Angela and Toms case sandwiching concentrated time with Victor and Jeannine between work and other obligations which often took precedence over family rituals meant that routines that signal parental caring and that are major sources of development went by the wayside For example family dinnertimes and storybook reading at bedtime became rare events So did the sheer enjoyment that comes from relaxed parentchild play a joint cooking art or construction project and a conversation based on real listening and exchange of ideas Because these experiences were so few and shortlived Angela and Tom were deprived of valuable opportunities to observe their children closely and to become intimately familiar with their talents shortcomings preferences styles of learning and ways of coping with hardshipknowledge that is crucial for helping children develop into mature competent individualsFurthermore the time bind sties an essential childrearing responsibility that I mentioned earlier and will return to again monitoring childrens experiences while they are both within and beyond parents immediate reach This includes frequently touching base with nonparental caregivers and teachers to nd out whats happening at child care or in the classroom looking in on sibling and peer interaction to make sure that it is positive and respectful and controlling time spent watching TV and playing video gamesIn a recent provocative study sociologist Arlie Hochschild spent months getting to know employees at a large Midwestern corporation she called Americo Whether clerical workers or executives the majority conrmed the parental state of mind just described They complained of overly long workdays and frenetic home lives A surprising nding however was that few Americo workers had taken steps to make work and family more compatible For example even wellpaid employees were not taking the annual six weeks of federally guaranteed unpaid family leave time although they could aord to do so Nor were they asking for job share or extime prominent company policies aimed at increasing the compatibility of work and home Hochschild concludes Many working families are both prisoners and architects of the time bind in which they nd themselves As homes become frenzied places in which work encroaches on family time and parents are too exhausted or preoccupied to be physically and psychologically available children quickly become discipline problems Their disagreeable behavior often causes parents to retreat further into the haven of work On the job such parents feel competent and gratied home has turned into a place where they are harried annoyed and must deal with children who sulk complain plead for gifts and are obstinate until they get their wayreactions that cry out Fifteen minutes here or there with an essentially distracted parent is not enoughFortunately not all reports are as disturbing as Hochschilds Psychologist Rosalind Barnett and journalist Caryl Rivers conducted extensive interviews with dualearner couples in the Boston area and found that despite stress at work and at home most were highly satised and found child rearing to be both manageable and pleasurable And in a survey of employees at DuPont nearly halfand only slightly more women than menturned down upward career moves to remain in jobs that allowed for more family commitment Barnett believes that parents most prone to a time bind in which work robs family life are at higher socioeconomic levelsin more pressured jobs that have less clearly dened limits and in which advancement typically depends on superlative performance Ironically she notes economically less well o parents nd it easier to establish a viable dividing line between workplace and homeAlthough the precise extent of familywork conict in American culture is not clear its presence and detrimental impact on parentchild interaction and childrens development are well founded Consider a series of studies that examined length of maternity leave in relation to employed mothers psychological wellbeing and parenting behaviors Short leaves of weeks or less the norm in the United States were linked to maternal anxiety and depression and negative interactions with babies But longer leaves of weeks or more predicted favorable maternal mental health and sensitive responsive parenting Furthermore long hours in child care during infancy and the preschool years are linked to less favorable parentchild interaction One study included repeated observations of more than mothers of diverse socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds playing with their children between months and years of age The more time children spent in child care which ranged from to hours per week the less positive and responsive their mothers behavior tended to be Children experiencing less positive interaction were less engaged with their mothersmore negative in mood and less aectionate Yet another studythis time of to yearold rstborn sonssuggested that long childcare hours can translate into behavior problems Mothers and fathers of boys with many hours in child care interacted less favorably with their sons And such parents reported more noncompliant deant child behavior These ndings are not an indictment of maternal employment or nonparental child care Rather they underscore the importance of considering the needs of children when making work and childcare decisions Studies carried out during the s and s on the relationship of maternal employment to childrens development revealed many positive outcomeshigher selfesteem better grades in school more positive family and peer relations and less genderstereotyped beliefs But repeatedly eective parenting mediated these favorable developments Employed mothers of cognitively competent welladjusted children value their parenting role and succeed at coordinating it with job responsibilities Such mothers schedule regular times to devote to their children and combine warmth with consistent expectations for mature behavior Consider a study of the relationship of maternal employment to rst graders academic and social competence Children of working mothers were equally or more competent than children of homemakers only if the children frequently experienced motherchild shared activities such as warm conversation and play Shared activities were especially crucial for children of mothers who had increased their hours of employment during the preceding years often from parttime to fulltime When a change in employment status was associated with high motherchild engagement children fared well When it led to reduced motherchild engagement childrens competence suered greatlyFathers involvement in child rearing is an additional route to positive outcomes for children Although women devote more than three times as many hours to child care as men do fathers involvement has risen in recent years Children of highly involved fathers score better on measures of intelligence school achievement mature social behavior and exible beliefs about gender rolesin short on all the positive outcomes associated with maternal employment When mothers and fathers support each other and share childrearing responsibilities both engage in more eective parentingIn sum increasingly pressured adult lives have contributed to parental diculties in granting children the attention they need When employed parents spend generous amounts of time engaged with their child they safeguard the childs development Under these conditions children often reap extra benets from more equitable involvement of both parents In contrast a pressured work life that pulls parents away from child rearing undermines infants and childrens wellbeingcognitively emotionally and sociallyProbably because it reduces work overload parttime maternal employment is associated with better academic and social development than is fulltime employment Unfortunately most American employers do not provide this option and many parentsespecially single parentscannot aord it Yet as noted earlier nancially wello parents are especially prone to the time bind but do not necessarily take advantage of available workplace options aimed at lessening itChildRearing AdviceAlmost all parentsespecially rsttime parentsfeel a need for sound advice on how to rear their children The demand for expert advice is particularly great today perhaps because parents teachers and the general public perceive that childrens problematic behavior has increased Widespread parent and teacher opinion gathered from nearly respondents in and again in revealed that during this year period children were viewed as more likely to do poorly on schoolwork hang around with peers who get into trouble and destroy things belonging to others Fewer were seen as involved in worthwhile activities that truly engaged them A survey of American adults of whom were parents echoed this disheartening trend Most viewed todays youngsters as too outofcontrol and undirectedThe call for parenting advice has led to a proliferation of volumes lling shelf after shelf in virtually every generalpurpose bookstore and public library The correct methods advocated in these books vary widely with many addressing discipline and communication thereby catering to rising numbers of parents with undercontrolled apathetic nongoaldirected children Precious few of these parenting manuals are grounded in the explosion of contemporary research on child development that is of signicant applied value Rather a plethora of opinion is available some of it playing on and exacerbating parents selfdoubts with such titles as Parenting for Dummies and The Seven Worst Things Parents Do onesided viewsWellknown theories of child developmentFreuds Skinners Gesells and Piagets for exampleprovide little comfort since dramatic shifts in favored theories have occurred since the launching of systematic study of children about years ago Indeed this waxing and waning of theories has contributed greatly to discrepancies in expert childrearing advice which like the theories has uctuated between extremesswinging like a rhythmic pendulum from an adultimposed directive approach to a childcentered laissezfaire approach and back again As one recent analyst commented theories and the popular literature for parents have done their share to undermine the wavering selfcondence of American parents The roots of these polarized perspectives can be found in centuriesold dramatically opposing philosophies about the nature of children and child developmentAdult Supremacy Writing at the end of the seventeenth century British philosopher John Locke characterized the child as a tabula rasa Translated from Latin this means blank slate or empty container a being who can be freely written on or lled with socially acceptable knowledge and skillsin essence molded in any way adults might desire through careful instruction eective example and rewards for good behavior Lockean ideas provided the footing for American behaviorism launched by John Watson in the early s and built by B F Skinner into a powerful midcentury theoretical force heralding the supremacy of environment in its belief that behavior is shaped by external stimuli By the s and s millions of parents had adopted behaviorist procedures in one form or another The most committed were welleducated mothers who read about conditioning methods in magazine articles and government bulletins on child care Heeding Watsons warnings about the dangers of overindulgence parents mapped out schedules and routines for their young children and tutored them in all manner of skills and in selfcontrolled conduct In preschools and kindergartens behaviorist tenets were used to justify largegroup drill on letters numbers and general knowledge as well as repetitive worksheet practice that required young children to sit at their desks for long periods lling in blanks coloring within the lines and otherwise following teacher prescriptions Parents anxious for their children to display mature behavior were convinced that these experiences would prime them for academic success But research eventually documented otherwisethat regimented tutoring not adjusted to the childs interests and capabilities undermines rather than enhances learning motivation and selfcontrol In preschools and kindergartens where much time is spent sitting listening to teachers and doing worksheets children exhibit high levels of stress behaviors such as wiggling withdrawal and talking out They also show a decline in selfcondence and motivation expressing doubts about their own ability and retreating from challenging problems Furthermore when followed up during the rst few years of school children who spent their kindergarten year in a highly teacherdirected classroom achieve more poorly than do agemates who come from kindergartens emphasizing play and handson smallgroup projectsRecall yearold Lydias dislike of her academic preschool described at the beginning of this chapter Lydias negative reaction is certainly consistent with research ndings The behaviorist presumption that development can be mechanically engineered by social input guaranteeing brighter socially more mature children is not borne out by the evidenceChild Supremacy Countering Lockes image of an allpowerful adult tutor eighteenthcentury French philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau conceived of the child as a noble savageuntamed but naturally good with an innate plan for orderly healthy growth According to Rousseau adult training served only to thwart the childs inherently perceptive intelligence and moral sense which unfolded naturally as children moved through a sequence of developmental stages The Rousseauian view provided the substrate for the twentiethcentury counterpoint to behaviorism a belief in the powerful role of childrens inborn characteristics At midcentury Freuds psychoanalytic theory vied with behaviorisms reinforcement principles for parents and educators attentions In the tradition of Rousseau the psychoanalysts argued that powerful biological forces channel development through four psychosexual stages Although psychoanalytic theory embraced a far less benign view of the childs instincts than did Rousseaus philosophy Freudian ideas were nevertheless strongly childcentered in declaring that not much could be done about the childs basic nature According to this view the childs sexual and aggressive urges must be harnessed in the interests of society but socializing too early or insistently can cause serious inner conict and psychological disorder Therefore psychoanalytic experts advised parents to avoid the trauma of heavy adult demands and accept childrens intrinsic dispositions and tendenciesThe Rousseauian childcentered theme surfaced as well in the realm of the childs intellect Swiss biologist Jean Piaget twentiethcentury giant of cognitive development proposed a theory in which an intrinsically motivated child acts on the world noticing discrepancies between the environment and inner structures or ways of thinking Gradually the child transforms those structures so they better reect reality and permit more exible ecient thinking and problem solving According to Piaget as the brain matures and childrens experiences expand they move through a sequence of four cognitive stages or reorganizations of thought sensorimotor the stage of infancy in which babies use their senses and movements to explore the world preoperational the stage of early childhood in which preschoolers use symbols especially language and makebelieve play to represent their earlier sensorimotor discoveries but thinking lacks the logic of older children concrete operational in which cognition is well organized and logical but limited to coordinating only two or three variables when solving problems and formal operational the stage of adolescence which opens up the capacity for abstraction permitting young people to coordinate an increasing number of variables and to imagine all possible outcomes in a problem not just the most obviousIn contrast to the behaviorist emphasis on adult tutoring Piaget believed that since development follows a natural internally controlled stage sequence what comes from within the child is paramount in guiding cognitive change The environment including the social environment is available for children to interact with as they make sense of their experiences but it does not determine the evolution of the childs mind Instead Piaget argued that children are in charge of changes in their own thinking and that biological readiness enables them to capitalize on a wider array of environmental opportunities both physical and social in revising inadequate incorrect mental structures and creating new onesPiagets contribution to the eld of child development is enormous He inspired more research on childrens thinking than any other single theorist Especially important Piaget convinced the academic communityas well as many parents and teachersthat children are active contributors to their own development have their own ways of understanding the world and must be developmentally ready if teaching is to be successful In the eld of early childhood education Piagets theory sparked preschool classrooms emphasizing discovery learning through childrens spontaneous interaction with the environment Rather than teaching didactically teachers in Piagetianbased settings provide a rich variety of handson activities and encourage childrens exploration and experimentation Educators inspired by Piagets work hope that by repeatedly applying cognitive structures in stimulating environments children will notice and amend deciencies in their thinking In a similar vein Piagets ideas served as a major impetus for the open education movement in elementary education which rapidly gained ground in the late s and early s It arose in reaction to the child passivity exacted in traditional classrooms where pupils sat at their desks listening to teachers transmit readymade knowledge and used textbooks as the main medium of learning A glance inside the door of an open classroom reveals richly equipped learning centers small groups of pupils working on tasks they choose themselves and a teacher who moves from one area to another guiding and supporting in response to childrens individual needsFurthermore childrens progress is evaluated dierently in open education than in traditional education Rather than tracking how well pupils keep pace with norms or the average performance of sameage peers openclassroom teachers evaluate children on an individual basisin relation to their own prior development Following Piagets lead this approach accepts the premise that children develop at dierent rates although it assumes that all follow the same stage sequence Undoubtedly because open education minimizes the importance of meeting normative standards openclassroom schoolage pupils fall slightly behind their traditionalclassroom agemates in achievement test scores Yet children in open settings display other benets including gains in critical thinking greater respect for individual dierences in their classmates and more positive attitudes toward schoolAs our discussion already suggests a central Piagetian tenet is that it is foolhardy to try to speed up development If children are masters of their own learning then adult eorts to teach them new skills before they indicate they are interested or ready are doomed to failure Because Piaget stressed the supremacy of childrens engagement with their surroundings over adult teaching parents and teachers contributions to development are severely reduced relative to the childs In sum compared to the behaviorist adultsupremacy perspective the Piagetian view stands at the opposite poleDespite Piagets overwhelming legacy his theory has been challenged Recent evidence indicates that Piaget underestimated the capabilities of infants and preschoolers and the direct contribution of adultsboth parents and teachersto cognitive change To illustrate lets look at preschoolers responses to Piagets conservation problemsthe bestknown examples of the odd logic of his preoperational stage Shown two rows of six pennies each after which the pennies in one row are spread out in a longer line a yearold is likely to say that the longer row has more pennies Similarly after a large ball of play dough is divided into six smaller pieces a preschooler usually insists that the six pieces have more play dough than the ball even though none was added during the transformation Yet a wealth of research reveals that when such tasks are scaled down in diculty for example using rows of three or four pennies rather than six or seven or made relevant to childrens everyday experiences pretending the play dough is cupcake batter and the six pieces are little cupcakes preschoolers understandings appear closer to those of older children and adults than Piaget assumedFurthermore in tribal and village cultures without formal schooling children who are cognitively adept in many ways master Piagetian conservation tasks much later than do children in industrialized nations This suggests that to grasp Piagetian concepts children must take part in everyday activities such as transforming the appearance of substances and reasoning about the result that promote this way of thinking Older children in preliterate communities who fail Piagetian tasks display other impressive cognitive capacitiesones required by and promoted in their culture For example among the Zinacanteco Indians of southern Mexico girls become expert weavers of complex garments through the informal guidance of adults In Brazil child street vendors with little or no schooling display sophisticated concepts of classication and equivalence as the result of buying candy from wholesalers pricing it with the help of adults and experienced peers and bargaining with customers on city streets Yet when tested for similar understandings on Piagetian problems these children do poorlyFinally many studies show that childrens performance on tasks such as conservation can be improved with training This along with the crosscultural ndings just described raises doubts about Piagets assumption that discovery learning rather than adult teaching is the most eective way to foster developmentabsence of a unified visionParents trying to make their way through these opposing theories and their attendant advice about childrearing and educational practice are likely to nd themselves in a dim forest without a discernible trail blazed before them Those who respond with sympathy and patience to their childs inclinations and demands are as taken to task as those who set clear expectations and relentlessly insist that their child shape up and comply with them Parents who throw up their hands in desperation and search through their own parents or grandparents shelves for a more tried and true vision will nd themselves mired in the same conundrum They might for example run across Arnold Gesells books of the s and sThe Infant and Child in the Culture of Today The First Five Years of Life and The Child from Five to Tenstill prominent in many bookstores Oering a lockstep description of physical intellectual and emotional milestones at each age Gesell aimed to reassure uneasy parents that childrens problematic behaviors were merely a phasepart of a biologically based sequence requiring understanding not correction A search of the previous generations parenting handbooks might uncover other volumes of this childcentered wave including In Defense of Children Children Have Their Reasons and even Stop Annoying Your Children and Parents Behave Experts of Gesells time complained that he went too far in downplaying the role of parents His advice was soon overshadowed by Benjamin Spocks standby Baby and Child Care published in and selling millions of copies over seven editions the most recent appearing in Providing answers to virtually any question about child rearing that might occur to a parent from physical care to emotional disciplinary and educational issues Spock seemed on many fronts to lean toward parental rmness and away from childrens ruleoftheroost A closer look however indicates that even Spock felt torn between the embattled forces of adult and child control He tried to grant legitimacy to both poles commenting that perhaps its not what you do but how you do it A strictness that comes from harsh feelings or a permissiveness that is timid or vacillating can each lead to poor results The real issue is what spirit the parent puts into managing the child and what attitude is engendered in the child as a result Above all Spock admonished parents to trust themselves to have the courage of their convictions Yet many parents at seain search of a sound childrearing ideology within the morass of clashing dictatesundoubtedly found Spocks directive hard to followThe past three decades have seen a continuation of this dichotomy of extremes in parenting advice and educational practice In the s titles appeared that blew the whistle on permissiveness and childcenteredness such as Dont Be Afraid of Your Child and Power to the Parents As part of this rebound Thomas Gordons Parent Effectiveness Training oered to rescue parents who had allowed their child to ride roughshod over them In the realm of childrens learning books in the behaviorist tradition advocating intensive early academic training resurfaced A prominent example Siegfried and Therese Engelmanns blueprint for raising a brighter preschooler Give Your Child a Superior Mind appealed to parents bent on boosting their childs IQ oreven betterproducing a genius In spelling out the theory the Engelmanns dismissed the legitimacy of biological readiness and proclaimedEvery single genius at the top end of the IQ scale received early training Every single one was subjected to an extremely active environment not one that folded its hands and waited for the child to mature The environment has to be empowered with the capacity to transform the universal baby A child is the product of what he learns His intelligence capacity and range of skills reect his environmenthis teachersEducational practice followed suit moving back toward traditionalism As Scholastic Aptitude Test SAT scores of American high school graduates plummeted and concern over the academic preparation of American children and youths became widespread a back to basics movement arose that by was in full swing Academic preschools ourished and kindergarten and primary classrooms returned to wholeclass teacherdirected instruction relying heavily on workbooks and frequent grading a style still prevalent today Bipolar tensions in parenting advice and in educational methods continue to the present day David Elkinds book The Hurried Child is among the bestknown of parenting volumes in the childcentered Piagetian tradition Elkind appealed to parents prone to live for and through their childs accomplishments to give up their vain desire for a superkid refrain from exaggerating the childs competence and stop rushing and pushing the child into adulthood In keeping with Rousseauian ideals The Hurried Child advises parents to protect children from the harsh realities of the grownup world and not to stress them out by expecting achievements beyond their biologically based limits As Elkind illustrates a yearold with many adult responsibilitiessuch as preparing breakfast doing housecleaning after school checking that a younger sibling is all right assisting with meal preparation and washing dishesbarely has time for her own personal homework responsibilities and is in danger of excessive stress from responsibility overload Schools too Elkind maintains hurry and stress children by assigning too much tedious work and rushing them from one subject to another depriving them of time to think and a sense of completionHarshly critical of the childcentered tenor of Elkinds message and pulling in the reverse direction is William Damons Greater Expectations an impassioned plea to parents and teachers to eradicate what the author characterizes as a rising insidious culture of indulgence in Americas homes and schools Too many childrenthe auent and the poor alikeare drifting through their childhood years without nding the skills virtues or sense of purpose that they will need to sustain a fruitful lifeAs Damon explains the childcentered philosophy was a major breakthrough when rst introduced in that it made parents and teachers aware that children have unique needs and benet from warmth and encouragement But Damon contends modern childcenteredness has been stretched to the point of unrestrained child gratication resulting in a youth culture in which children and adolescents are less engaged less purposeful less accomplished academically and more egoistic and antisocial than in previous generationsDamon acknowledges that economic constraints and other family pressures play a part in this youth disaection But he places most blame on how contemporary children are reared Childcenteredness Damon explains has become an excuse for a rudderless parenting and educational culture that makes few demands while fostering in children a stressfree feelgood attitude in which children are told Youre lovable Youre great Youre terric regardless of what they do But because these messages have no basis in meaningful attainment they are counterproductive Sooner or later children see through them come to mistrust the adults who repeat them and begin to doubt themselvesDamon neither endorses the insensitivity of adult dominance nor the tumultuous reign of the child Instead he underscores that children are avid active learners but adults must cultivate their drive toward mastery They must induce children to develop talents skills good values and a sense of accomplishment through engagement not just in activities that are easy and fun but in ones that are meaningful and challengingthat help them sustain eort in the face of diculty overcome obstacles and advance to greater heights As Damons message suggests in building an eective vision of child development and child rearing neither the childs inner thoughts and feelings nor the role of adult guidance can be singularly extolled or wholeheartedly ignored To do either leads parents and educators to become trapped in a false opposition to vacillate and to think in oversimplied ways about how best to help children realize their potential to learn and become personally and socially responsible toward a balanced perspectiveThe popular parenting literature is notable for lagging substantially behind advances in childdevelopment theory and research Today sound theories and educational strategies exist that are neither adult nor childcentered but instead portray both as participating actively jointly and inseparably in the process of development On only one point is the popular parenting literature unanimous the vital importance of getting development o to a good start during the preschool years The earlier adults begin and the more continuously they engage in eective practices the more likely children are to sustain eort achieve in school develop productive interests and become responsible caring individuals The longer adults postpone and the more unpredictably and inconsistently they behave the greater the chances that children will develop maladaptive habits and unfruitful interests doubt their capacities become dissatised with themselves and despair about their prospects for the future After decades of theoretical division and debate a new more complex view of child development is coalescing in the eld supported by rapidly accumulating research evidence The fragmented polarized theories of the past are giving way to more equitable theories emphasizing that the child and the social environment interact and that the contributions of each to development cannot be separated and weighted in a simplistic onesided mannerUnderstanding this new view can be immeasurably helpful to parents caregivers and teachers in providing children with developmentenhancing experiences since it oers a way of thinking about child rearing and education that they can call on to guide decision making in daily life But a vital prerequisite for enacting this perspective is that parents especially must arrange their lives in such a way as to invest time and energy in young children Indeed as we will soon see some childrenbecause of genetic background biological risk or previous inept caregivingrequire more intensive investment of parental energies than do others Before we take up this emerging theoretical consensus lets address the question of whether greater parental commitment in the context of todays demanding and stressful work lives is possiblereevaluating the time bindParents as I noted earlier often complain that they have too little time for childrenindeed too little time to sleep read cook exercise and socialize as well Their sense of being overworked and overcommitted with few moments to spare must be taken seriously Feeling constantly frazzled can in and of itself interfere with relaxed patient investment in childrenYet how pernicious and unique to our lives is this time bind To gain perspective on this question I contacted a noted historian of family life who suggested that I consult John Ises book Sod and Stubble in which Ide chronicles his mother Rosies life on a homestead in rural Kansas in the late nineteenth century as she farmed kept house and reared eleven childrenSettling with her husband Henry on the land in a oneroom cabin Rosie cooked on a stove so small that she could bake only two loaves of bread at a time so she had to bake almost every day She sewed to make the familys entire wardrobeher own her husbands and each of her eleven childrens Keeping up the cabin posed constant diculties Cracks in the oor planks and in the log walls permitted various pests to enter so Rosie battled bedbugs grasshoppers and ants which required frequent searches of the house with a kettle of hot water in one hand and a can of kerosene and a feather in the other Always preparations had to be made for the next seasonin the fall for example cooking enough molasses to last the winter a task requiring weeks of workOutside Rosie assisted Henry with myriad choresherding and feeding livestock making lye from wood ashes to be used in hulling corn for hominy browning rye for coee harvesting wheat and planting and caring for trees owers grapevines and a vegetable garden When she was not helping with the crops and the garden she could be seen washing and hanging out huge baskets of clothes On rainy days Rosie grabbed pans from the shelves to catch the water that dripped through the cabins sod roof remaining poised to shift the pans from place to place as new leaks sprang Still Rosie and her husband Henry had time for their children as well as time to participate in family gatherings community events and learning and literacy societies While the children were small they accompanied their parents on outings and during outdoor choresfor example riding in the rear of the cornhusking wagon where Rosie and Henry could easily see and talk to them As they grew older the children played at adult tasks and soon joined in and helped with many of them Despite grim work lives Rosie and Henry who had little schooling themselves sent nine of their children to college and some to graduate school They managed to be involved and caring parents without all the comforts and timesaving conveniences that we now take for granteda watertight roof central heating fast foods microwaves vacuum cleaners washing machines and dryers automobiles telephones and much much moreThough Rosies and Henrys way of life was hard and we shouldnt go too far in romanticizing it their story helps us put the contemporary time bind in perspective It suggests that many parents who feel overwhelmed by lifes demands ought to be able to free up more time for their childrenthe rst step toward highquality child rearing Recent research by timeallocation experts John Robinson and Georey Godbey substantiates this conclusion Although Americans perceive their work hours as excessive squeezing out other aspects of their lives a dierent picture emerges when they keep detailed diaries of how they spend their time Every years since Robinson and Godbey have gathered daily time diaries from thousands of respondents representing a crosssection of the American population They discovered that not only are peoples gross estimates of time per week devoted to work to hours higher than those recorded in their diaries but free timetime unencumbered by any obligationshas actually increased Americans are working less than they did in about fewer hours per week for men fewer for women Diaryobtained estimates of free time average hours per week for employed men for employed women Robinson and Godbey note that compared to a generation ago the free time of Americans is more plentiful but also more disjointeda half hour here an hour there How do they spend it Americans report that TV viewing consumes nearly percentabout hoursof their unallocated moments It seems easier to watch the news or an episode of a favorite TV show than to go to a concert enjoy a leisurely family dinner or take the children to a museum or the zooTimediary ndings also verify that time constraints are greater for higherincome Americans Yet the income gap in free time is not large nancially wello individuals average only to hours a week less free time than do their less economically advantaged counterparts Weekly free time for privileged Americans with demanding careers is still plentiful If free time is so abundant why do so many parents say their lives are pressure cookers The reason Robinson and Godbey suggest is that our pace of life is faster People expect to do more to live more intensely Hence they try to speed up the yield of time often by doing several things at oncein the case of Angela and Tom attending to work tasks while xing dinner watching TV and elding Victor and Jeannines urgent pleas for attention The very activity of squeezing more into the moment exacerbates the belief that time is scarce This timefamine sensation is the wellspring of parental eorts to create quality time in the absence of quantitya contradiction in terms How can parents beat the time bind Rather than merely cultivating timesaving skillsa remedy that by itself may even further compress time spent with childrenRobinson and Godbey recommend that parents nd ways to meld timesaving with timesavoring When parents have fulltime jobs some time pressure is bound to be presentin getting shopping laundry and cleaning done meals on the table and children to and from child care school and various activities Yet to grant children adequate attention and involvement there is no substitute for slowing down and reexamining the pace of everyday life Parents must ask questions like these Does my family have a sitdown meal together on most days of the week free from the distractions of a blaring TV and a constantly ringing telephone Do I have time on most days to interact oneonone with each of my children Do I involve my children positively and usefully in play and recreation and in accomplishing tasks of daily livingshopping cleaning gardening cooking decorating and repairing Do I provide my children with predictable routines clear consistently enforced rules and sucient oversight while they are both within and beyond my immediate supervisionpractices that help ensure that the time I share with them is plentiful pleasurable and constructively spentClearly true quality time for children is quantity time and more Fashioning time for parents and children to be together is the rst step toward implementing the ideas and practices Ill discuss in this book A second step is an appreciation of the multiplicity of factors that contribute to developmentan understanding that spells out parents vital role yet claries how it joins with other forces to aect childrens development and wellbeing child development a new consensusAt the dawn of a new millennium a fresh set of theories of child development has blossomed The new approaches are numeroussome more concerned with motor skills others with cognitive competencies and still others with emotional and social development Yet they form a consensus a set of variations on a unied theme Each borrows features from past perspectives that have withstood the test of time and integrates them with current evidence The result is a new outlook on how children acquire more complex and eective skills Many Factors Contribute to DevelopmentThe new view assumes that many elements internal and external to the child work together as a dynamic synergistic system to aect childrens thinking feeling and acting These elements include the childs heredity and biological constitution the people and objects in the childs everyday settings of home childcare center school and neighborhood community resources for child rearing such as familyfriendly workplace policies and highquality aordable child care and cultural values and customs related to child development and educationLook closely at these ideasthat children are aected by interwoven factors in biology everyday contexts and cultureand you will see that contemporary researchers are no longer onesided in how they view the power of the child versus the adult or heredity versus environment Most have turned away from asking which inuence is more important to uncovering how nature and nurture work together to aect the childs traits and capacitiesIn addition researchers now realize that quite normal children show both similarities and dierences in pathways of change A common human genetic heritage and basic regularities in childrens physical and social environments yield certain universal broad outlines of development At the same time biological makeup everyday tasks and the people who support children in mastery of those tasks vary greatly resulting in wide individual dierences in specic skills And because children build competencies by engaging in real activities in real contexts dierent skills vary in maturity within the same child Recall the Zinacanteco Indian child weavers and the Brazilian child street vendors who are advanced in skills relevant to their own culture yet behind on tasks devised for children in Western industrialized nations They oer a dramatic illustration of developmental variationboth between children and within the same child Heredity and Environment as Inseparable Within this dynamic system in which inner and outer forces jointly engender development each contributing factor inuencesand is inuenced bythe others Therefore the roles of heredity and environment of the child and important people in his or her life so closely interconnect that according to some experts their inuence is inseparable To illustrate lets take two vibrant contemporary research topics relevant to young childrens learning the dramatic growth of the brain during the rst years and young childrens temperaments or genetically inuenced styles of relating to their physical and social worlds brain development Many people think of infancy and early childhood as a time when the human brain is especially sensitive to experience In line with this view although genes provide the code for basic brain structures and functions heredity goes only so far in aecting the organization of the childs brain and the rate at which it develops The environment has a crucial profound impactHow does early experience join with biology to aect brain development The cerebral cortex seat of human intelligence undergoes dramatic growth during the rst few years Almost all its neuronscells that store and transmit informationare in place by the second trimester of pregnancy Once established neurons begin to take on unique functions by sending out branching bers which form elaborate connections with other neurons Formation of this complex communication system contributes to an enormous increase in size of the brainfrom nearly percent of its adult weight at birth to percent by age and percent by age As neurons form connections a new factor becomes vital in their survival stimulation Neurons stimulated by the surrounding environment continue to establish new connections which support more complex functions Neurons seldom stimulated soon lose their connections as their bers atrophy Notice how for the biological side of brain development to go forward appropriate stimulation is essential while formation of neural connections is at its peakDuring early childhood the brain is highly plastic or adaptable in that many brain regions are not yet committed to specic functions This means that if a part of the brain is damaged other parts can usually take over the tasks that would have been handled by the damaged region provided they are granted the necessary stimulation In a study of preschool children with a wide variety of brain injuries sustained in the rst year of life psychologist Joan Stiles found that cognitive decits were milder than those observed in braininjured adults And by age virtually all impairments had disappeared As the children gained perceptual cognitive and motor experiences stimulated intact areas of the cerebral cortex compensated for the early damage By age to most brain regions have taken on specic functions so brain plasticity declines Because of rapid brain growth and gradual decline in brain plasticity the rst to years of life are regarded as a sensitive phase of development in which appropriate stimulation is necessary for children to reach their full genetic potentialIn describing the close connection between brain growth and experience I have used the expression appropriate stimulation By this I mean neither impoverished conditions nor excessive bombardment with sights and sounds but input that the child can absorb as indicated by his or her approach interest and concentration In Burton White and Robert Helds classic study of the impact of early stimulation on development young babies in a barren institution given a moderate amount of stimulation tailored to their ability to handle itat rst a few simple designs on the side of their crib and later a fancy mobilereached for and explored objects six weeks earlier than did infants given nothing to look at A third group of babies given massive stimulationpatterned crib bumpers and fancy mobiles beginning in the rst few weeks of lifealso reached for objects sooner than did unstimulated babies But this heavy dose of enrichment took its toll The massively enriched infants looked away and cried a great deal and they were not as advanced in reaching and exploring as the moderately stimulated babiesMuch research conrms that overloading children with input leads to disorganization of behavior Excessive stimulation also causes them to withdraw as they try to shield themselves from a stimulus deluge thereby creating conditions that paradoxically are much like stimulus deprivation These ndings help us understand from a braindevelopment perspective the detrimental impact of excessive adult tutoring on young children described earlier in this chapter They also raise grave concerns about the recent proliferation of expensive commercial early learning centers in which infants are barraged with letter and number ashcards and slightly older toddlers are drenched in a full curriculum of reading math science art music gym and more Rather than optimizing early neurological growth as proponents claim these eorts to jumpstart young children can inict considerable harm robbing them of a healthy start on the road to maturityOur rapidly expanding knowledge base on brain development and childrens learning reveals that a genetically inuenced roadmap for brain growth and a developmentally appropriate environment go hand in hand the impact of each depends on the other Appropriate stimulation wires the brain prompting it to form new connections and its regions to specialize As this process goes forward the brain gradually becomes receptive to increasingly complex and varied stimulation This fosters further elaboration and specialization of brain structures and ever more advanced knowledge and skills temperamentFrom the earliest ages children vary greatly in preferences interests talentsand in temperament or style of emotional responding the most thoroughly studied of these sources of individual variation Temperament encompasses activity level ability to attend to stimuli and capacity to adjust the intensity of emotions to a comfortable level so the child can remain adaptively engaged with his or her physical and social surroundings Temperamental dierences among infants and children are of great interest to researchers because temperament is believed to form the cornerstone of the adult personality A wealth of research reveals that for children to develop at their best the experiences adults provide must be adapted not just to childrens general neurological progress but also to their unique temperamental needs Temperamental traits most often studied include attention span fear of novel experiences irritability when desires are frustrated and quality of mood positive versus negative Parents can rate their childrens temperamental qualities fairly accurately their judgments show a reasonable correspondence with researchers observations of childrens behavior Teacher ratings are even more precise since teachers are familiar with many children and therefore have a broader basis for judging whether a particular child is high low or intermediate on dimensions of temperament Lets see how temperament combines with brain development and experience forming a complex dynamic system that shapes the course of development Take Larry who when brought as an infant to a highly stimulating laboratory playroom was agitated and upset by all the new sights sounds and people Yet baby Mitch when introduced to the very same playroom watched with interest laughed and eagerly approached the exciting toys and strangers Larry scores high on the temperamental dimension of fearful distress On observing him most of us would call him a very shy inhibited child Mitch in contrast scores low on fearful distress and high on positive mood He is in everyday language an uninhibited sociable childTo chart the development of shy and sociable children psychologist Jerome Kagan followed several hundred youngsters from infancy into the school years repeatedly observing their behavior and measuring their physiological responses to highly stimulating unfamiliar events As babies about percent were easily upset like Larry whereas percent were comfortable even delighted at new experiences like Mitch According to Kagan individual dierences in arousal of an inner brain structure called the amygdala which controls avoidance reactions underlie these contrasting temperamental styles In shy inhibited children novel stimuli easily excite the amygdala and its connections to the cerebral cortex and sympathetic nervous system which prepares the body to act in the face of threat The same level of stimulation evokes minimal neural excitation in highly sociable uninhibited children Indeed shy childrens physiological responses to noveltya rise in heart rate pupil dilation blood pressure and blood concentration of cortisol a hormone that combats stressresemble the reactions of very timid animals and are known to be mediated by the amygdala When neural messages from the amygdala reach the cortex they lead a shy child to interpret new experiences negatively and a sociable child to interpret them positively Indeed brain waves in the cortex dier strikingly for these two types of childrenAre these early biologically based temperamental styles destined to last restricting learning opportunities for shy children while opening new doors for their sociable counterparts The answer once again depends on experienceespecially parenting practices When parents shield infants and preschoolers who dislike novelty from minor stressessuch as eating and sleeping in a new setting or meeting new peoplethey make it harder for the child to overcome the urge to retreat from unfamiliar events Under these conditions heredity and environment act in concert to maintain the childs fear increasing the likelihood that it will translate into longterm adjustment diculties such as excessive cautiousness social withdrawal loneliness and by school age overwhelming anxiety in the face of academic challengesThis does not mean that a shy child should be forced into new situations with coldness harshness and impatiencetactics that magnify their dread of new and unpredictable events Instead parents who warmly but consistently and assertively require their inhibited child to try new experiences and guide and support them in doing so actually reduce the childs physiological stress reactions fostering a more adaptive style in the child Indeed adult eorts of this kind are believed to be largely responsible for the fact that about percent of extremely inhibited babies cope with novelty more eectively as they get older although practically none become highly sociableShy and sociable children also require dierent adult interventions to promote exploration of their surroundingsan activity that as Piaget pointed out is essential for optimal cognitive development Vivacious stimulating parental behavior including frequent questioning instructing and pointing out objects is benecial for reserved inactive infants it helps them become interested in and engaged with novel toys Yet these same parental behaviors interfere with exploration in very active outgoing children For these youngsters too much adult intervention is intrusive it dampens their natural curiosity Consequently appropriate stimulation varies for these two types of childrenFinally culture aects the likelihood that parents and teachers will respond to shy children in ways that foster their development In Western nations shyness is regarded as a form of social maladjustmenta perspective that heightens the chances that adults and peers will react negatively to inhibited childrens reticence and retreat In China adults evaluate shy children positively as advanced in social maturity and understanding The high value placed on selfrestraint in Chinese culture leads shy children to receive very positive feedback from adults and peers Consequently inhibited Chinese youngsters appear particularly well adjusted during the school yearswell liked by their classmates and rated by their teachers as academically and socially skilledThe Roles of Parents and Other Adults Agents of Change Buffers Gatekeepers and Conveyors of Culture Environmental forces from adultchild interaction to cultural values join with heredity to aect the development of children with other temperamental dispositions as well Throughout this bookand especially in Chapter which addresses the development of children with physical and mental disabilitieswe will see many more examples of these synergistic eects In each the role of parents and teachers as agents of change is vigorous and profound although not sovereign and exclusive Parents cannot erase their childs genetic propensities but they can alter many of them in a favorable direction especially if they have access to knowledge about eective child rearing and they intervene in early childhood the years of greatest neurological malleability Furthermore when parents and other adults apply good rearing practices they serve as buers or sources of protection for children against threatening forces in the wider world A common thread in research on the impact of stressful life events and conditions including poverty divorce abuse community violence and wartime trauma is that a close relationship with a parent relative or teacher who introduces aection assistance and order into the childs life fosters resiliencymastery of cognitive and social skills that enable the child to withstand and even overcome adversity To be sure children who are relaxed socially responsive and able to deal with change are more likely to elicit the support of parents and other adults At the same time children can develop more attractive dispositions and adaptive skills as the result of parental warmth attention and consistent guidanceParents and teachers also act as gatekeepers for young children Depending on the experiences they oer they open up or close o a great many avenues for learning These include toys books television computers special lessons weekend outings time with grandparents and other extended family members as well as the quality of child care schooling and the neighborhood they choose to live in depending of course on the extent to which communities oer viable choices In all the ways just mentioned parents and other adults are vital conveyers of culture through direct teaching of attitudes and values and through the pervasive imprint of culture on the settings and activities they provide for children In the hands of parents and teachers lies the awesome responsibility of conveying to the next generation the intellectual scientic aesthetic and moral achievements that dierentiate our species from others From the simplest preliterate society to the most technologically advanced nation adults are charged with ensuring that children acquire competencies that enable them to assume a responsible place in their society and ultimately participate in transmitting its values and practices to future generations Of course children have an important say in the socialization process For example they usually become more expert at those skills that complement their native talents And depending on their dispositions the road to maturity may be rockier requiring greater investment of parental energies and distinct childrearing strategies Moreover without a doubt peers contribute greatly to socializationespecially by helping children learn to resolve conict cooperate share form deep attachments beyond the family and otherwise behave in ways that foster social harmony But the recent widely publicized claim of Judith Rich Harris in her book entitled The Nurture Assumptionthat parents are minor players who are overshadowed by childrens genetic makeup and peer cultureis not correct Indeed many eminent child development researchers have countered Harriss thesis Genes and peers do not supplant adult agents including parents grandparents aunts uncles family friends and teachers Harris draws on evidence suggesting that childrens inherited intellectual and personality attributes lead them to evoke particular responses from adults which further strengthen the childs inherited traits For example a friendly baby receives more social stimulation than a quiet passive infant a cooperative attentive preschooler receives more patient and sensitive interaction than does an inattentive distractible child and a bright advanced child is praised and stimulated more than a child developing more slowly Hence Harris concludes most children follow a genetically preordained developmental course regardless of parental inuenceAlthough Harris is correct that children often evoke behaviors from parents and others that strengthen their genetic tendencies research clearly shows that parents can and often do uncouple these childtoparent eects Indeed the substantial malleability of temperament in infancy and early childhood is explained in large measure by the fact that many parents and other adults are successful in guiding children with maladaptive tendencies toward more eective functioning Moreover decades of research on intelligence show that IQ although not innitely pliant varies greatly with the stimulating quality of childrens experiencesFurthermore no conclusive evidence exists for the assertion that the most consequential environment for childrens development is the peer group rather than the family It is based on an array of selective and equivocal ndings mustered to convince readers that parenting eects are conned to how children behave in parents presence and do not extend beyond the home I will show repeatedly in this book that just the opposite is sothat parenting practices have much to do with childrens competence at language and communication sensitivity to others feelings and needs capacity to get along with others within and beyond the family achievement in school and guiding values beliefs and attitudesIn fact this overriding emphasis on peers as a source of positive development is itself a product of our culture Compared to other nations the United States is more peeroriented it places greater value on gregariousness and being liked by agemates As more American parents with busy stressed lives retreat from their children peers take over Without a constructive link between the values taught at home and the values of the peer group the consequences of high peer orientation are decidedly negativea rise in school failure aimlessness drug use teen pregnancy antisocial behavior and other youth problems of current concern in the United StatesDownplaying the role of parentssuggesting that they are relatively unimportant in socializationdoes both families and society a disservice It leads parents like Noah and Suzanne who are on the cusp of a dramatic period of development in their yearold sons life to express grave doubts about their own importance Harvard University psychologist Howard Gardner notesChildren would notcould notgrow up to be members of a civilized culture if they were simply left to the examples of their peers A social scienceor a laymans guidethat largely left out parents after birth would be absurd So would a societyWhether on the scene or behind the scenes parents have jointly created the institutions that train and inspire children apprenticeships schools works of art and literature religious classes playing elds and even forms of resistance and rebellion These institutions and the adults who run them sustain civilization and provide the disciplineshowever fragile they may seemthat keep our societies from reverting to barbarismsociocultural theory dialogues with children This book takes its inspiration from sociocultural theory one of the dynamic synergistic perspectives that has recently captivated the eld The central idea of sociocultural theory is that the child and his or her social surroundings join to provide direction to development participation in social life guides and energizes the childs mastery of new culturally adaptive skills Because sociocultural theory focuses on childrens access to and interaction with cultural experts it has much to say to parents and teachers about how they can help children develop into responsible contributing members of society Sociocultural theory originated with Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky who carried out his highly innovative research during the s and early s writing prolically on the contribution of social experience to childrens learning After the Soviet Unions twentyyear ban on Vygotskys writings was lifted in the mids his major works reached the West They began to be translated into English in the s and s By the s many American psychologists and educatorsdoubting the Piagetian view of development and desiring to account for wide variation in childrens competenciesembraced Vygotskys ideas with enthusiasmAccording to sociocultural theory cooperative dialogues between children and more knowledgeable members of their society are necessary for children to acquire the ways of thinking and behaving that make up a communitys culture These dialogues occur frequently and spontaneously as adults and children spend time togetherin everyday situations such as household chores mealtimes play storybook reading outings in the community and childrens eorts to acquire all sorts of skills Although interactions that arise between adults and children may seem mundane and inconsequential at rst glance sociocultural theory emphasizes that they are powerful sources of childrens learningConsider the following conversation between Mel and his yearold son Ben as the pair took a summerevening walk on a California beach near their home Mel had brought along a plastic bag as the beach was often littered with trash after a busy dayBen running ahead and calling out Some bottles and cans Ill get them Mel If the bottles are broken you could cut yourself so let me get them Catches up and holds out the bag as Ben drops items inBen Dad look at this shell Its a whole one really big Colors all inside Mel Hmmm might be an abalone shellBen Whats abaloneMel Do you remember what I had in my sandwich on the wharf yesterday Thats abaloneBen You eat itMel Well you can You eat a meaty part that the abalone uses to stick to rocks Ben Ewww I dont want to eat it Can I keep the shellMel I think so Maybe you can nd some things in your room to put in it Points to the shells colors Sometimes people make jewelry out of these shells Ben Like moms necklaceMel Thats right Moms necklace is made out of a kind of abalone with a very colorful shellpinks purples blues Its called Paua When you turn it the colors changeBen Wow Lets look for Paua shellsMel You cant nd them here only in New ZealandBen Wheres that Have you been thereMel No someone brought Mom the necklace as a gift But Ill show you New Zealand on the globe Its far away halfway around the worldIn this dialogue which lasted only a few minutes Mel conveyed important social values and a wealth of information to Benabout responsibility for preserving the environment about safety precautions about the wonders of an unusual sea creature about the beauty and utility of natural objects and even about world geographyAccording to sociocultural theory as adultsand more expert peers as wellhelp children participate in culturally meaningful activities the communication between them becomes part of childrens thinking Once children internalize essential features of these dialogues they use the language within them to accomplish new skills and to gain control over their own thought and behavior The young child speaking to herself when tempted by a forbidden object Dont touch solving a dicult puzzle Where does this piece go nding an interesting shell on the beach Looks like Moms shiny necklace or acting out a scene in makebelieve play What would you like for lunch An abalone sandwich has started to produce the same kind of guiding comments that an adult previously used to help the child think about the world and engage in important tasks A Socially Formed MindSociocultural theory is unique in viewing inner mental activity as profoundly social The thoughts and imaginings that make us distinctly human are not regarded as independently constructed by the child Rather the child derives them from his or her history of relations with other people According to Vygotsky infants are biologically endowed with basic perceptual attentional and memory capacities that they share with other animals These undergo a natural course of development through direct contact with the environment during the rst two years of life similar to the process of exploration and discovery described by Piaget For example all babies gradually distinguish objects and people in their surroundings and realize that these entities continue to exist when out of sight They also merge objects that are alike into categories such as vehicles animals birds and eating utensils laying the foundation for mentally representing their experiences and thinking eciently And they become adept at imitating others a powerful means for acquiring new skills These and other infant capabilities set the stage for language which develops with extraordinary speed after year of age By ages to most children are skilled conversationalists by age they have mastered most of the grammatical rules of their language and have vocabularies as large as ten thousand words The milestones just cited are broad universals of development They characterize children everywhere as long as they are biologically prepared to learn and live in stimulating physical and social surroundings But once children become capable of representing objects and events with symbols especially language their ability to participate in dialogues is greatly enhanced This leads to a crucial change in development The natural line of development makes closer contact with its surrounding social context merges with it and is transformed by it Childrens social exchanges begin to inuence their ways of thinking more profoundly than before permitting them to acquire competencies in keeping with the requirements of their families and communitiesA basic premise of sociocultural theory is that all uniquely human higher forms of thinkingincluding controlled attention to tasks memory strategies reections on experiences and ideas techniques for solving problems and imaginationare deeply aected by childrens social experiences For example when a parent suggests to a young ball player Watch me keep your eyes on the ball the adult helps the child control attention essential for mastering any complex task When a teacher says Lets write the names of our snack helpers on the board or Put all the animals together and all the vehicles together she teaches vital strategies for remembering And a parent or teacher who asks Is Brenda crying because you took her colored pencils What can you do to become friends again encourages children to reect on their experiences and to think of eective techniques for solving social problemsVygotsky emphasized that to understand childrens development it is necessary to understand the social situations adults devise for them Any higher form of thinking he pointed out rst appears in social communication between the child and representatives of his or her culture as they engage in a joint activity Only later does it appear within the child as an individual capacity or skill The childs mind then is a profoundly social organ Through social life it makes contact with and is inuenced by other more expert minds permitting transfer of the values knowledge and skills essential for success in a particular cultureThe Importance of LanguageBecause Vygotsky regarded language as the major bridge between our social and mental worlds he viewed language acquisition as the most signicant milestone in childrens cognitive development Language is our primary avenue of communication with others and means through which we represent our experiences Once children start to think with words language becomes an indispensable tool of the mind Just as a hammer is a tool used to gain control over and transform physical objects so we call on language to inuence the thought and behavior of other people and ourselves Language not only conveys culturally meaningful ideas but is itself deeply imbued with culture Italong with other symbolic tools such as gestures aids to memory systems for counting works of art diagrams and mapsis the product of the social history of a cultural group the result of members eorts to create a communal way of life Indeed the central purpose of language from its moment of emergence is communication social contact inuencing surrounding individuals Then it becomes an individually applied tool for governing our own thoughts and actionsTo illustrate how Vygotsky envisioned this close connection between social interaction and childrens thinking and behaving lets look in on another verbal exchange between a parent and a young child Deb is pulling weeds in the garden while yearold Maggy follows along alternately digging with her small spade and holding a toy telephone to her ear Soon gray clouds appear along the horizon and thunder can be heard Maggy frightened by the booming sounds whimpers to Deb Scary Mommy Go insideThat thunder is way up in the sky far away Deb explains pointing o in the distance It cant hurt you We need to get these weeds out before the rain comes Just a little longer and then well go insideMaggy listens and responds Not scary far far away and Deb nods in agreement As Maggy waits she paces back and forth near Deb speaking into her toy phone Not scary thunder Far away Get the weeds Not scary boom boom Like a big drum Maggy has taken the communication jointly generated with her mother and turned it toward herself She uses speech derived from that conversation to reect on the thunder allay her fear and help her wait until Debs task is nished and they can go inside As Maggy thinks aloud with words she converses with herself in much the same way that she interacted with her mother Over time Maggy will start to interact with herself silently inside her head And as Maggies social experiences expand and become more complex she will continue to weave aspects of them into her inner dialogues acquiring new more advanced ways of thinkingA nal point about thinking as internalized social interaction Note that Maggys telephone conversation with herself is not a simple copy of Debs remarks to her The sociocultural vision is very dierent from behaviorism which views development as directly imposed or shaped by external forces Instead children are active agents contributing to the creation of their own thought processes by collaborating with more experienced cultural members in meaningful activities The combination of child and adult leads to the communication between them Then children actively take over this interaction and gradually adapt it for ecient and eective selfcommunication shortening and personalizing it To capture this idea of children selecting from social interaction in ways that t their goals some experts like to say that the child appropriatesor adoptstools of the mind Others continue to describe the child as internalizing social experience but emphasize the childs unique contribution to both adultchild interaction and its internalization Whatever label is applied active engagement on the part of both adult and child resulting in a meeting of minds is central to this processPurposeful Activities and Culturally Adaptive CompetenciesChildren learn and practice thinking by participating in purposeful activities organized by their cultural community This ensures that they will acquire competencies that are adaptive in their culture At very young ages when children are just beginning to acquire culturally valued skills they depend almost entirely on interactions with more expert cultural members to make sense of their experiences For example when researchers tested yearolds to nd out what they remembered about a visit to a museum the children recalled only information they had talked about with their mothers everything else had been forgotten When young children do not understand a concept or how to solve a problem most often they lack experience in relevant activities with more expert individuals For example some ethnic minority children who grow up in more peopleoriented than objectoriented homes do less well than they otherwise would on academic tasks because they rarely participate in activities involving educational toys games and a questionanswer style of adultchild interaction What color is that How many wheels on that truck which prime children for academic success Yet these very same children who do poorly in the classroom can be seen telling complex stories engaging in elaborate artistic activities competently watching over younger children and accomplishing athletic feats in daily lifeThe importance of activity contexts reminds us that all children do not face identical tasks Cultures and adults within them responsible for socialization select dierent tasks for childrens learning As a result childrens cognition is contextualized it emerges and derives meaning from particular activities and social experiences Parents who spend little time in joint pursuits and conversation with their children convey to them a very dierent set of cultural values practices and cognitive strategies than do parents who involve their children in constructive play and projects encourage them to participate in family routines and duties such as meal preparation and cleaning and plan parentchild outings Similarly teachers who require mostly solitary desk work from children isolating the skills taught from their everyday use promote values and competencies strikingly dierent from those cultivated by teachers who embed teaching and learning in meaningful collaborative activitiesThe core lesson to be learned from our discussion so far is that development is a matter of childrens geneticbiological potential undergoing a cultural metamorphosis a process that cannot take place without parents and teachers as thoughtful and committed participants in childrens lives From the sociocultural perspective parents and teachers are leaders in awakening childrens minds and fostering their development children are apprenticed to these experts Hence to Talias concern posed at the start of our discussion Should she and her husband Jim respond to yearold Anselmos pleas for help with his homework Given what we currently know about how children develop the answer is a resounding yes Rather than promoting dependency as Talia and her husband fear assisting Anselmo is the surest route to competent functioning provided parental interaction builds on Anselmos current capacities and remains sensitive to his unique characteristics Now lets turn to just how parents and teachers can advance childrens knowledge and skills Talia and Jims fear of helping yearold Anselmo with his homework lest they create a dependent immature child is a peculiarly Westernand profoundly Americanpreoccupation American middleclass parents typically regard young children as dependent beings who must be urged toward independence In response to researchers queries they frequently say that babies should be trained to be selfreliant from the rst few months Consequently they place a high value on childrens learning and doing on their own Repeatedly relying on others for assistance is construed as weakness uncertainty and lack of capacity In keeping with this view many American parents worry that if their children seek help they may become dependent A similar view permeates traditional classrooms where an individualistic value system prevails Children must do their own work In the most intensely individualistic of these settings conferring with your neighbor is worse than dependency it is cheating and teachers go so far as to set up barriers between pupils such as upright books and cardboard screens to prevent itThis emphasis on independent accomplishment is not broadly accepted around the world Indeed adults in some nonWestern cultures regard American parents as rather merciless in pushing their young children toward independencefor example when they insist that infants sleep alone rather than with their parents or when they take pleasure in the earliest possible mastery of motor skills such as crawling and walking long before the child has acquired the reasoning powers to avoid steep staircases and busy roadwaysDiverse nonWestern peoples and American ethnic minorities stress interdependencethat children must feel intimately linked to others to become competent and selfreliant Chinese Japanese Vietnamese GuatemalanMayan eastern Kentucky Appalachian and many other cultural groups regard newborn infants as psychologically separate beings whose most important task is to develop an interdependent relationship with their communityan emotional and social foundation that is crucial for survival and learning Witness the following conclusion by a researcher who compared American with Japanese infant rearing practices An American motherinfant relationship consists of two individuals a Japanese motherinfant relationship consists of only one individual ie mother and infant are not divided These contrasting parenting perspectives reect underlying family and community values Japanese parents and other ethnic minorities adhere to a collectivist worldview in which people dene themselves in terms of their relationships with othersCollectivist values also alter the way teachers and children think about classroom learning Were you to visit a school on an Israeli kibbutz cooperative agricultural settlement you would nd an explicit emphasis on cooperation and avoidance of pupil comparisons and a far more positive attitude toward children who seek help than is common in American schools When asked why children look at each others work kibbutz pupils mention the importance of connecting with others to acquire new skills They explain If your picture looks crooked you would want to see your friends paper to learn how to make it straight or If you arent sure what youre supposed to do then you should check To the same question American and Israeli urban children typically respond I would want to see whose picture was the best or I might be wondering whether she got more right than I did from interdependency to autonomyVygotsky who studied and wrote about childrens development in Russia in the early twentieth century was deeply interested in how interdependencychildrens close ties to their communitycan pave the way to competence and autonomy His sociocultural theory has thoroughly collectivist cultural roots Vygotsky stressed that children need social interaction and meaningful activities to develop and he regarded high intrinsic motivation and mature independent functioning as arising from the support granted by cultural experts as children attempt ever more challenging tasks The childs mind Vygotsky pointed out extends beyond the skin and is inseparably joined with other minds Out of this interconnection springs mastery prociency and selfcondenceNevertheless a deeply ingrained American belief is that satisfying a young childs desire for social contact and assistance will be habit forming leading to a clingy spoiled youngster Much evidence veries that this is not ordinarily soConsider the early attachment bond that builds between caregiver and baby during the rst year of life By age to months infants single out their parents and other stable loving caregivers for expressions of joy and turn to them for comfort when anxious and afraid An overwhelming consensus of research shows that sensitive caregivingresponding to the babys cries for physical care and stimulation promptly consistently and appropriatelysupports the development of a secure attachment relationship Securely attached infants actively seek contact with and are easily consoled by their familiar responsive caregiver Yet such infants are not destined to become immaturely dependent Rather by the end of the rst year their exploration of the physical world is condent persistent and complex And they are less likely to cry and more likely to use gestures and words to express their desires than are infants whose parents delayed or failed to respond to their calls for help Sensitive care builds an interdependent relationship between parent and babyone in which physical and emotional closeness becomes the context for encouraging more mature behavior Attachment serves as the springboard for a great many capacities that make their rst appearance in the second yearselfcondence compliance and cooperation awareness of others needs and desires and empathy and sympathy emotions that enable us to feel for and help others in need But the parent who fails to respond promptly and predictably intervening only after the baby has become extremely agitated teaches the infant to rise rapidly to intense distress The baby has learned that only when he is distraught will the parent reliably come to his aid As a result he is more dicult to soothe to encourage to communicate in ways other than crying and to guide in acquiring other vital competenciesAn analogous circumstance exists at older ages as Anselmos interactions with his parents reveal Jims refusal to help Anselmo with his homework in hopes of instilling independence is counterproductive Anselmos crying and pleading accelerate to the point that anxiety prevents him from focusing on the task Denying Anselmo assistance yields precisely what it was intended to preventa dependent doubting child As Anselmos parents refrain from helping they fuel his anger and demandingness and ultimately his sense of helplessness When Talia nally responds she does so out of desperationto stop Anselmos agitated appeals which are about to escalate beyond control Consequently Talia assists inappropriately by doing the task for himAnselmos resulting disorganized behavior and dependency prompt additional parental vacillationsometimes refusals to help at other times maladaptive helpingalong with exasperation and criticism Talia and Jim can be heard saying impatiently You arent any good at this Cant you do anything Soon a barrier forms between Anselmo and the task he had previously wanted to master and his motivation wanesIn classrooms the same sequence of events prevails Teachers communication plays a vital role in childrens eort and learning Consider a recent study in which elementary and middleschool pupils were followed over a year period Those who viewed their teachers as warm and as providing helpful learning conditionsby making expectations clear and checking that the child understoodworked harder on assignments and participated more in class Eort and participation in turn predicted better academic performance which sustained the childs willingness to try hard in the future In contrast children who regarded their teachers as unsupportive were more likely to disengage stop trying and show declines in achievement These negative outcomes led children to doubt their own ability which perpetuated their reduced eortHow can adults build interdependent relationships with children that foster the development of culturally meaningful skills and mature autonomous behavior To answer this question Vygotsky proposed a special concept the zone of proximal development Keeping it in mind can help parents and teachers interact with children in ways that lead their development forward the zone of proximal developmentTake a few moments to list ve or six competencies of a child you know well If you are a parent do so for your own child if you are a teacher choose a child in your class Perhaps your list looks much like this one recorded by Jessica mother of yearold Tyrone Just learned to cut paper with scissorsCounts to fourLooks at picture books and names many picturesRemembered two of the animals we saw at the zoo last Sunday Puts together puzzles with eight piecesCan sort shapes into categoriesNow indicate whether the skills on your list are ones that the child can do by himself or whether they are ones that the child displays only when assisted by another person Jessica like most parents and teachers completing this exercise limited her list to Tyrones already acquired abilitiesones he can do alone Vygotsky pointed out that we are used to thinking of the childs capacities in static or fossilized termsas nished achievements In doing so we look toward the past What we should do he advised is to move beyond what children can do by themselves to what they can do with expert assistance and therefore have the potential to learn In this way we focus on the futureon the cognitive processes of today or tomorrow rather than those of yesterday which are already mastered Vygotsky dened the zone of proximal development as the distance between the childs actual development the tasks the child can do individually and the childs potential development determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers The zone as Ill call it from now on is the dynamic region in which new capacities form as children tackle culturally meaningful tasks with a mentors assistance Had Jessica been thinking about Tyrones zone she might have framed the items on her list this way Just learned to cut paper with scissors If I hold the paper while he cuts and prompt him he can cut along straight or curved lines He cut out a square and a circle with help today I asked him which animals we saw at the zoo and he mentioned girae and zebra When I reminded him of the bird and pachyderm houses he remembered a lot more the amingos parrots swans elephants hippos and rhinosFor Vygotsky a crucial aspect of parenting and the central aim of education is to provide children with experiences in their zoneactivities that challenge them but that can be accomplished with sensitive adult guidance Consequently parents and teachers carry much responsibility for ensuring that childrens learning is maximizedfor actively leading them along the developmental pathway Rather than transmitting readymade knowledge to a passive child or giving a child tasks for which he or she already has the requisite skills the adults role is to engage in dialogue with the childby observing conversing questioning assisting and encouraging During that dialogue the adult continually assesses the childs progress and creates the zone by keeping the task proximalslightly above the childs level of independent functioning In this way the adult rouses to life those cognitive processes that are just emerging in the child sustaining them socially so they can be rened and internalized as part of the childs psychological worldcreating the zoneWhat features of adultchild shared activity forge the zone Research documents several communicative ingredients that consistently foster development in children of diverse ages and across a wide range of tasksShared UnderstandingFor information ideas and skills to move from the socialinteractive plane to the internalthinking plane the adult and child must strive for a common approach to the situation They must desire genuine communication and work toward attaining it In sociocultural theory this joint mutual focus is called intersubjectivity or shared understanding As the word suggests each participant in the dialogue strives to grasp the subjective perspective of the other an eort that results in a meeting of minds in which the partners thoughts make contact connect and coincide Intersubjectivity reaches its pinnacle in a love aair where shared understanding is readily achieved through a glance a touch or a comment Lovers in close psychological contact grasp one anothers meanings quickly because each is on the lookout for and tries to satisfy the others needs The opposite of intersubjectivity is total misunderstanding In a failed love aair widely divergent views of the same experiences cause people to say You dont understand me Youve become a stranger We cant nd common ground Weve grown apartThe image of lovers communicating helps us appreciate the circumstances in which intersubjectivity is most likely to occur in close relationships Children most often attain it with parents other family members teachers and eventually in friendships with peers Of course partners in teaching and learning do not need to attain the intersubjective heights of lovers to accomplish their goals But a certain degree of intersubjectivity is necessary for any dialogue to be successful and the love aair analogy reminds us that joint understanding whether established in facetoface interaction or as individuals work on a common task combines both verbal and nonverbal cues Sensitive emotional messages conveyed through gestures facial expressions and tone of voice are basic to it Intersubjectivity is itself a developmental process Since infants and young children are still acquiring communication skills the younger the child the greater the adults responsibility for making mental contact and sustaining the interaction Nevertheless children of all ages actively join in striving for a shared view of the world Their participation results in gains in thought language and social skills Gradually the child takes increasing responsibility for attaining intersubjectivity until both parties make similar contributions to the shared mental state that fuels childrens learning in the zone Lets see how with adult support the childs intersubjective competence increases infancy and toddlerhoodSome researchers believe that the infants capacity to share meaning with others is innate Others think it is learnedthat parents respond to infants facial expressions vocalizations cries and body movements as if they have meaning and out of those responses infants pick up the meanings and expressive rhythms of human signals But all experts agree that subtle sensitive and mutually rewarding exchanges between parent and baby serve as the earliest context for intersubjectivity From the start infants are equipped with capacities that draw adults into social exchanges with them Newborn babies for example can make eye contact and they prefer to look at people and to listen to human voicesespecially their mothers familiar voice to which they became accustomed during the months before birth Newborns also have a rudimentary ability to imitate facial expressions opening their mouths or pursing their lips after an adult does so Their responsiveness encourages parents to look at talk to and imitate in return Between and weeks of age babies begin to smile at people an irresistible signal that evokes smiles cuddles pats and friendly gentle verbalizations from their social world As cooing and babbling appear in the rst halfyear adults again respond in kind vocalizing and waiting for the baby to vocalize backBy age months a complex communication system is in place in which parent and baby each respond in an appropriate and carefully timed fashion to the others cues As a result babies experience and practice the giveandtake of human conversation Disrupt this exchange of signals and young babies striving for connection with others becomes crystal clear In several studies researchers had the parent assume either a stillfaced unreactive pose or a depressed emotional state Infants tried all manner of signalsfacial expressions vocalizations and body movementsto get their mother or father to respond again When these eorts failed they reacted to the parents sad vacant gaze by turning away frowning and crying American Canadian and Chinese to montholds respond to a parents still face identically suggesting a common builtin protest response to caregivers lack of engagementWhen parents are attentive patient and interested in the babys activities their social signals sustain the infants attention essential for a shared focus Around months infants begin to gaze in the same direction adults are looking although their initial eorts are imperfect Parents follow the babys line of vision as well often commenting on what the infant sees This joint attention to objects and events fosters early language development Mothers who maintain high levels of it during play have infants who comprehend more language produce meaningful gestures and words earlier and show faster vocabulary development between and years of ageBetween and months the capacity for intersubjectivity takes a giant leap forward Toddlers use gestures to share their experiences with others They touch an object hold it up or point to it while looking at another person to make sure he or she notices Or they try to get another person to do somethingto hand them an object or help them perform a taskby reaching pointing and making sounds at the same time Look closely at these behaviors and notice how toddlers intentionally try to establish common ground with another person by combining their interest in objects and events with communication When adults respond to their reaching and pointing gestures and also label them Thats a kitty isnt it Oh you want a cracker toddlers learn that using language can quickly lead to a joint focus and desired resultsthe pleasurable object or experience the child wanted Soon the child utters words along with gestures the gestures recede and language is under wayearly childhoodSpoken language brings vastly expanded potential for attaining intersubjectivity because it allows much greater clarication of purpose between participants in a dialogue When a toddler points and reaches but cannot say what he means the adult may need to search for the childs meaning as this exchange between a mother and her monthold son Jordan illustrates Jordan Points to one of the objects on the counterMother Do you want this Holds up milk container Jordan Shakes his head no continues to point two more tries Mother This Picks up sponge Jordan Leans back in highchair puts arms down tension leaves bodyMother Hands Jordan spongeAs language competence increases shared meaning is established quickly as when the child says Get the sponge Mom I need to wipe this up Then a joint focus becomes the springboard for achieving greater understanding with children playing a strong contributing role This is evident in the impressive conversational skills of even young preschoolers By to years children take turns make eye contact and respond in a timely and relevant fashion to their partners remarksThese capacities improve with conversational experience Children become better at taking the perspective of their partner especially a partner who adjusts his or her communication to the childs level and observes the child closely to assess his or her comprehension By stretching up to grasp the adults viewpoint children acquire new knowledge the basis for further growth And with age children exert greater eort to understand another person a capacity rst cultivated in adultchild interaction and then extended to peers For example in the following conversation notice how yearold Sammy assists his friend Leah in attaining intersubjectivityLeah tells the teacher that she caught a fish while on vacation when Sammy enters the conversationTeacher Did you have to scale the sh as wellLeah No we eated them The child misunderstands the meaning of the word scaleSammy You need to peel them peel them Sammy tries to clarifyTeacher Confirming Sammys meaning You need to take the scales o dont youSammy You cant do it with your hands you need a peelerTeacher Or a knife a really sharp shing knifeLeah They peeled the shes with a fork Leah now shares meaning with the teacher and SammyBetween and years of age preschoolers increasingly strive for intersubjectivity in dialogues with peers They more often arm playmates messages add new information to playmates ideas and make contributions to ongoing play to sustain it further They can also be heard making such statements as I think this way What do you thinkclear evidence of a willingness to share viewpoints which assists preschoolers greatly when conicts arise that must be resolved for play to continue As the excerpts we have considered illustrate participants in a dialogue may not attain intersubjectivity on a rst try and interaction between most people whether adults or children is not perfectly in sync But by the preschool years children can take a more active role in helping a partner reach a state of shared thinking and in correcting misses when they do occurThe communicative competence inherent in intersubjectivity blossoms within a zone of proximal development in which parents and other signicant adults are stimulating attentive conrmatory interpretive and highly supportive Parentchild intersubjectivity makes a vital contribution to the development of attachment attention language and understanding of others perspectives These capacities in turn ease the task of establishing an intersubjective connection and that connection provides the platform for the creation of additional zones enabling children to master complex culturally adaptive skills Building a Support System for Acquiring New Knowledge and SkillsIntersubjectivity makes possible a second essential ingredient for creating the zone a support system that oers new ways of thinking about a situation The quality of adult support varies with the type of joint activity As we will see a helpful parent or teacher interacts dierently when assisting the child with tasks having clear learning goals such as working a puzzle or mastering a homework assignment when engaging the child in an openended conversation and when enlisting the child in duties and routines of everyday living But regardless of the activity the adult adapts his or her support so the child can make use of it As the child gains competence adult support changes accordingly granting the child a larger role creating a scaffoldThe metaphor of a scaffold has been used to describe eective adult support as children work on tasks that teach culturally valued concepts and skills The learning goal might be built into the task materials as when a child turns a crank to make a jackinthebox pop out puts together a puzzle or builds a structure out of blocks Alternatively the parent or teacher might specify the goal as in matching shapes and colors solving an arithmetic problem or batting a ball In scaolding the child is viewed as a buildingactively under construction The adult provides a dynamic exible scaoldor frameworkthat assists the child in mastering new competencies To promote development the adult varies his or her assistance to t the childs changing level of performance with the goal of keeping the child in the zone This is usually done in two ways by adjusting the task so the demands on the child at any given moment are appropriately challenging and tailoring the degree of adult intervention to the childs current learning needs When a task is very new the child may not yet be aware of its goal and need to be shown what to do through demonstration Consider for example a monthold infant who has never before seen a jackinthebox At rst the adult tries to capture the childs attention by working the toy and as the clown emerges exclaiming Pop What happened Gradually the adult redirects interaction toward how to use the jackinthebox When the infant reaches for the toy the adult guides the childs hand in turning the crank and pushing the clown down in the box As motor cognitive and language skills improve in the second year the toddler intentionally tries to turn the crank looking at the adult or otherwise beckoning for assistance The childs greater knowledge and communicative competence permit the adult to reduce her physical directiveness Now the adult can help from a distance by using verbal instructions Turn just a little more and gestures such as a rotating hand resembling a turning motion while the toddler tries to make the toy work As children move into the preschool years scaolding becomes increasingly verbal and takes on the advantages of languagemore ready attainment of intersubjectivity exible ecient representation of meanings and a powerful tool through which minds meet and the child adopts meanings into mental life To illustrate lets listen in as a father assists his yearold daughter Sydney in putting together a dicult puzzleSydney I cant get this one in Tries to insert a piece in the wrong placeFather Which piece might go down here Points to the bottom of the puzzleSydney His shoes Looks for a piece resembling the clowns shoes but tries the wrong oneFather Well nd a piece that looks like this shape and matches this color Points again to the bottom of the puzzleSydney The brown one Tries it and it fits then attempts another piece and looks at her fatherFather There you have it Now try turning that piece just a little Gestures to show herSydney There Puts in several more pieces while commenting to herself Now a green piece to match Turn it meaning the puzzle piece as the adult watchesFather Now Sydney watch Suppose I put this piece here Will that work Places a blue piece next to a second blue piece but the space is too small and the wrong shapeSydney You cant do it that way The piece is too bigFather What should I doSydney Places the piece in the correct space using both color and shape as a guideSydney and her fathers interaction contains all the components and goals of eective scaolding Joint Problem Solving Aimed at Keeping the Child in the Zone Sydney and her father collaborate in overcoming obstacles that Sydney encounters In doing so father and daughter jointly work toward successful puzzle solution Sydneys father keeps the task within Sydneys zone by temporarily reducing the diculty of the puzzle He does so by breaking the task into smaller units focusing Sydneys attention on the lower sectionthe part with the largest and most easily matched pieces Then he assists with a general prompt Which piece might go down here When Sydneys father observes that this suggestion is not sucient for her to succeed he oers additional support Find a piece that looks like this shape and matches this color and Turn it His statements contain strategies attending to color and shape patiently adjusting pieces so they t that Sydney can use in future attempts When Sydney experiments with the colormatching strategy and succeeds in placing the brown piece she internalizes the technique She applies it in subsequent eorts regulating her behavior with selfdirected language resembling her fathers communication during joint problem solving Consequently Sydney begins to move toward independent solving of the puzzleNotice how in scaolding Sydneys puzzle solving her father adapts the instruction he oers to Sydneys momentary competence When Sydney has diculty he forties the scaold providing increased direction Once Sydney starts to take over strategies generated during joint problem solving her father pulls back reducing the assistance providedScaolding provides parents and teachers with a sensible solution to the oftenraised dilemma Is it better to be directive or nondirective when helping children learn As the scaolding concept shows this question has no pat answer Rather the intensity of adult support depends on where the task falls within the childs zone When a task lies at the outer edge of the childs current capabilities more direct guidance is necessary to bring it within range of mastery As the childs understanding and performance improve less intervention is required How much assistance a child needs depends not just on cognitive maturity but also on other child characteristics A temperamentally distractible child an emotionally reactive child or a fearful inhibited child requires an especially sturdy scaoldextra support and at times considerable adult perseverance to sustain a joint focus and keep the child engaged Children who are good listeners persistent in the face of diculty socially skilled and therefore adept at attaining intersubjectivity need less adult vigilance and direction At the same time eective scaolding can improve a dicult childs behavior since it oers the child knowledge and procedures for solving problems the security of adult support as long as it is needed and the satisfaction of overcoming obstacles and mastering culturally valued skills Selfregulation An important goal of scaolding is to promote selfregulationthe capacity to use thought to guide behavior The selfregulated child follows social rules makes deliberate wellreasoned choices and decisions and takes responsibility for his or her own learning and behavior Although selfregulation improves gradually throughout childhood and adolescence early childhood is a crucial period for its developmenta time when children learn to overcome impulses by thinking before they act Indeed selfregulation is so important for childrens cognitive and social development that we will return to it repeatedly in later chapters when we consider how other experienceschildrens selfdirected language makebelieve play and learning in schoolcontribute to it How does scaolding nurture a selfregulated child It does so in two interrelated ways by providing children with strategies for working toward goals and by relinquishing adult control and assistance as soon as the child can work independently In scaolding the adult encourages the child to grapple with questions and problems and thereby to contribute signicantly to the dialogue In this way the adult evokes from the child his or her current knowledge and on that basis can scaold more eectively The parent or teacher intervenes only when the child is truly stuck granting the child as much opportunity to master his or her own behavior as possible Unless it is clear that the task is so new and obscure to the child that a demonstration would be helpful the adult refrains from giving immediate answers to momentary diculties As our consideration of Anselmo and his parents revealed doing the task for the child severely reduces learning and selfregulationWhen adults ask children questions and make suggestions that permit them to participate in the discovery of solutions then transfer of useful strategies to the child is maximized By introducing language as a mediator of the childs activity the adults questions and prompts prevent the child from responding impulsively They encourage the child to step back from the immediate situation and consider alternativesin essence to think Look at Sydney and her fathers dialogue once again When he asks Which piece might go down here he evokes Sydneys present strategic thinking nding that it is still tied to immediate objects in the situation Sydney looks for the clowns shoes but fails to nd them Then her father introduces a special form of strategic thinking called distancing This method helps children move beyond concrete objects by looking for higherorder relationshipsin Sydneys case categorizing puzzle pieces by color and shape Once Sydney succeeds in using color her father encourages further distancing from the most obvious features of the clown image He places a piece incorrectly by matching only on color and queries Will that work In doing so he helps Sydney analyze an error consider how to correct it by matching on both color and shape and try out her conjecture Sydney gains practice in applying strategies exiblyin generating ideas to overcome obstacles As a result she acquires reasoning skills and can take initiative when faced with future problems Warmth Responsiveness and Encouragement To work well the emotional tone of scaolding must be warm sympathetic and responsive Children who experience warm adult relationships want to preserve that spirit of aection and cooperationby joining in dialogues with adult partners and acquiring culturally valued skillsThe standards for maturity parents set for young children vary widely in ways that reect family and cultural values For example ChineseAmerican immigrant parents report spending nearly ten times as much time as do CaucasianAmerican parents scaolding their schoolage childrens mastery of reading math music and drawing skillsteaching that is undoubtedly a strong contributor to Chinese childrens high achievement in both academic and artistic endeavors Inuenced by the Confucian belief in strict discipline to nurture socially desirable behavior many Chinese and other Asian parents expect a great deal of their children and structure their time extensively But research indicates that their demands are imbued with warmth and caringwith deep concern for and involvement in their childrens lives In a study of parenting in societies anthropologists Ronald and Evelyn Rohner found that warmth combined with at least moderate expectations for mature behavior and accomplishment is the most common childrearing style around the world Why do so many cultures mingle concern and aection with guidance and controla blend known as authoritative parenting in the childrearing literature Certainly because they sense its eectiveness borne out by decades of research Authoritative parenting whether assessed through direct observation or older childrens ratings of their parents communication is linked to many aspects of competence In early childhood it predicts positive mood selfcondence and independence in mastery of new tasks cooperativeness and resistance to engaging in disruptive behavior And in middle childhood adolescence and young adulthood it is related to high selfesteem social and moral maturity academic achievement and educational attainmentA major contributor to these favorable outcomes is the fuel that warmth grants to adult expectations Warm caring adults oer explanations and justications for their demands In doing so they invite children to judge the appropriateness of their requirements When children view demands as fair and reasonable they are far more likely to heed and internalize them A warm involved adult is also more likely to be an eective reinforcing agent praising children for striving to meet high standards And when children stray from goals that a parent or teacher regards as important and it is necessary to be rm and disapproving a warm adult has a much greater chance of changing the childs behavior than does an adult who has been indierent or negative Children of involved caring parents nd the interruption in parental aection that accompanies a reprimand to be especially unpleasant They want to regain their parents warmth and approval as quickly as possibleIn sum scaolding is a warm sympathetic collaboration between a teacher and a learner on a challenging goaldirected task that the adult helps bring within the childs zone Observations of adultchild pairs reveal that the diverse ingredients of scaoldingmatching the adults assistance to the childs changing needs suggesting eective strategies posing questions that encourage children to think about higherorder relationships and interacting warmly and praising children for competent performanceconsistently relate to childrens task engagement and learningthe power of conversationThe instructional mode of communication inherent in scaolding is well suited for tasks with clearly dened goals Conversations in which adult and child reect on everyday events are more freeranging They can dwell on virtually any aspect of experienceof living and working together This makes them an especially powerful tool for assisting children in building an internal mental life infused with a cultural worldviewWhen people converse with one another they engage in a form of dialogue called narrativea storylike mode of communicating composed of a sequence of events with people as main characters In the narrative which may be real or imaginary characters roles and mental statesfeelings intentions beliefs opinions and knowledgeare revealed To illustrate suppose someone asked you to tell the story of your life In forming a spontaneous autobiography people link together smaller stories about incidents and occasions with the self at their center and other inuential people in supporting roles The narrator arranges the stories sequentially to conform to a culturally accepted organization of time And he or she not only recounts but justifies the storiesthat is makes them comprehensible by explaining why they happened as they did The ministories in our life narratives focus on exceptional experiencesevents that stand out against the backdrop of ordinariness in our daily lives For example a move to a new neighborhood a rst date a high school graduation an important job interview a wedding day the birth of a baby and special achievements or failings are likely to be included The various entries are derived from our social interactions at the time the events occurred and thereafter When others join with us in celebration approve or disapprove of our actions or convey information or opinion that changes our outlook they bestow special meaning on the events And so we include those events in our autobiographies elevating them to lifelong signicance In everyday conversation the events discussed resemble the ministories of our spontaneous autobiographies For example in recent narrative exchanges I talked with a friend about her daughters sudden breakup with a anc with my husband about a controversial play we had seen and with one of my students about how she might handle a troublesome roommate Each narrative focused on a relatively exceptional personal experience And in each my partners and I addressed the legitimacy of characters intentions weighing personal desire against socially acceptable behavior For example referring to her daughters breakup my friend complained It wasnt that she did it but how she did it She shouldnt have promised shed join him in Chicago and then reneged His mother called a few days later and said how betrayed the young man feels You cant back out like that with no warning no explanation after he had already rented the apartment The whole family knew the relationship had problems I countered Shes paying him for the apartment Doesnt that lighten her obligation During the conversation my friend and I exchanged a wealth of cultural meanings about how relationships should be and about the maturity and morality of the daughters behavior The telling of the narrative also invited reconstruction of what might have occurred between the daughter and her anc thereby placing the event in a wider context of possibilities In the process the dialogue highlighted characters internal statesthe daughters motivations her boyfriends feelings and my friends struggle to make sense of the breakupReadiness for Narrative Our narrative dialogues with young children have the same features as do our narratives with adults only in simplied form In these conversations we arrange events in logical sequential order and we focus on explaining unusual hardtointerpret occurrences often by dwelling on characters intentions and perspectivesEven before they begin to talk children display a readiness to participate in narrative After an adult describes and demonstrates some activity for example putting a teddy bear to bed yearolds who as yet have little language can easily reproduce the main steps in correct sequence with toys When toddlers begin to speak their main interest is in talking about what people do and the consequences of their behavior Listen to the twoword utterances that appear between and months of age and you will nd many expressions like these Tommy hit Get cookie Mommy truck meaning Mommy push the truck Daddy outside and My dolly At the end of the second year children begin to label their own and others internal states with words such as want happy mad think and pretend These assertions about human action desire emotion and perspective are the stu of which narratives are madeEarly on children are sensitive to yet another feature of narrative At birth they are captivated by unusual events perking up their eyes and ears when something new and dierent happens In keeping with this innate bias the rst narratives children produce focus on making sense of the atypical Look the sun is sleepy going to bed said yearold David while watching the sun disappear below the horizon at the end of a day at the beach At the sight of a woman with her leg in a cast yearold Rachel remarked Mommy that lady got a big cut The doctor sewed up her leg Rachels brother had cut his leg a few days earlier and returned from the doctor with stitches and a bandageAn early armament of narrative tools enables children to quickly and easily comprehend and contribute to the narratives of expert members of their culture In families in which parents and children spend much time together the ow of stories recreating personal experiences is abundant Through them adults help children construct increasingly elaborate images of themselves and teach them culturally accepted ways of organizing and interpreting their experiences As a byproduct of participation children gain a rich understanding of their own and others mental livespowerful tools in predicting and explaining human behavior and therefore in getting along with others And in enabling children to practice and perfect narrative skills adultchild conversation provides crucial preparation for literacy Lets take a closer look at these diverse benets of narrative conversationForming an Autobiographical Self Consider once again the narrative task posed earlier to relate the story of your life Think back to the earliest event you can remember At what age did it occurFor the large majority of people memory for autobiographical events begins around age Practically none of us can retrieve happenings at younger agesa phenomenon called infantile amnesia What causes this early memory blackout and how is it that after age certain events dierentiate themselves from a multitude of everyday experiences so they stand out for a lifetimeSome researchers conjecture that growth of the cerebral cortex and other brain structures is necessary before children can store experiences in ways that permit them to be retrieved many years later Similarly several psychological explanations focus on changes in the nature of memory during the preschool yearsfrom an unconscious automatic and nonverbal system to one that is conscious deliberate and verbal Perhaps the second system cannot access events stored by the rst making the earliest events of our lives forever irretrievableYet the idea of vastly dierent approaches to remembering at young and older ages has been questioned Children to years old can describe their memories verbally And sometimes they even recall events that happened to them as preverbal infants For example while walking past a distinctive house with a fencedin front yard monthold Lisa said to her mother Scary doggy Nine months earlier before the child could talk the family had taken the same walk On that occasion Lisa had seen a ferocious dog barking behind the chainlinked fence Over time neither the family walk nor the scary dog will be part of Lisas personally relevant memory Yet the train trip across the country she will take at age and her rst day of kindergarten at age may still be memorable when she is A growing number of researchers believe that rather than a radical change in the way experience is coded into memory two other milestones lead infantile amnesia to give way to memory for personally signicant experiences A Psychological Self To build an autobiographical memory children must have a wellformed sense of selfas a person who despite changes in appearance a new haircut becoming taller and more mature looking remains the same on the inside over time Once constructed this persisting psychological self serves as an anchor for unique experiences which are retained easily as long as they become personally meaningful A psychological self is not rmly in place until age or An Autobiographical Narrative Besides a rm sense of an inner self autobiographical memory depends on organizing personal experiences in narrative form so they become part of a life story How do children learn to structure memories as narratives during the preschool years Much evidence indicates that they acquire this skill through conversations with adultsAs early as to years children begin to talk about the past guided by adults who prompt them and expand on their fragmented recollections At rst parents provide most of the content and structure of the story But very soon childrens contribution increases as can be seen in this short excerpt of a mother talking with her nearly yearold daughter about a recent Halloween celebrationChildOnce on Halloween the kids was over and I had a princess dress on meMother You had a princess dress on Did you get any candy Did you go door to door What happenedChild We went treatingMother You went treating And who took youChild Andreas mother took us And my mom and we brought a pumpkin tooMother What did you do with the pumpkinChild We lighted itMother What did it look like Was it scaryChild Uhhuh Dad made cuts in it with a razor He made a face too That was funnyNotice how the mother provides details and by asking who and what encourages her young daughter to enrich the narrative As children participate in these dialogues they adopt the narrative thinking generated in them and retain many details about past events made personally meaningful in the context of parentchild conversationObservations of parentchild interaction reveal that parents vary in how they engage children in narrative talk Some like the mother in the conversation just given use an elaborative style in which they pose many varied questions add information by building on childrens statements and volunteer their own evaluations of events as in Was it scary Other parents use a repetitive style Appearing rushed impatient and inattentive to the childs comments they contribute little information and ask the same shortanswer questions over and over Do you remember Halloween What costume did you wear Do you remember what you wore The elaborative style is considerably better at fostering preschoolers narrative skill since and yearolds who experience it produce more coherent and detailed personal stories when followed up to years laterChildrens conversations with elaborativestyle parents increase in complexity as language development proceeds creating a zone of proximal development in which narrative competence expands Between and years childrens descriptions of special onetime eventsa family excursion a grandparents visit a rst trip to the dentistbecome better organized and more elaborate Spurred by adult prompting older children also add more background informationwhen and where the event took place and who was present By including these details children place personally signicant experiences in the larger context of their lives Finally between and years of age evaluative statements which help to clarify why an event is personally meaningful become common Older children more often embellish their descriptions with modiers such as My mask was ugly or The kite ew high At times they even add drama by intensifying these expressions as in The kite ew very very high and Grandma ate a huge bowl of oatmeal for breakfast And like the autobiographical and everyday narratives that adults generate childrens narratives increasingly focus on peoples internal statestheir desires feelings and beliefs She wanted it so much or I felt bad Furthermore the richness of yearolds evaluative remarks can be predicted from their mothers evaluative statements in an adultchild conversation years earliera nding that underscores once again parents vital role in creating a zone for narrative development In sum as children share memories mark them as personally meaningful and begin to create their life story the people to whom they are close become vigorous contributors to their selfconstructions From the beginning the childs sense of self is not isolated encapsulated inside the head Rather it is shaped by and situated in childrens everyday social experiencesin the dialogues with parents teachers and other cultural experts within families preschools schools and communitiesAcquiring Cultural Beliefs and Values Through dialogues with adults the child derives not just a self but a self imbued with culture The stories both real and ctional that parents and teachers relate to or jointly construct with young children are laced with cultural beliefs and values They have profound socializing implicationsAt times adults tell children stories that carry important selfrelevant lessons For example recently I listened in as a father and his yearold son waited in the foyer of a synagogue for a Jewish New Year service to begin The father wove an animated tale about a boy named Chaim who had great diculty remaining quiet during the holiday service Little Chaim had a brand new whistle in his back pocket and he badly wanted to play it With great eort he resisted turning and twisting in his seat until nally when the Rabbi blew the shofar ceremonial rams horn Chaim could bear it no longer A moment later the clear highpitched sound of the whistle could be heard over the Rabbis nal shofar blast Everyone in the sanctuary turned toward Chaim who cringed with embarrassment But much to Chaims surprise all the congregants cheered and thanked him for making the shofar ritual more beautiful than ever And Chaims father praised him for sitting quietly almost to the end of the serviceFiveyearold Mark listened to his fathers story with rapt attention asking questions and adding personal comments Where did Chaim sit Did he like Mark bring a book to read Was Chaim allowed to get up and go to the bathroom Was the Rabbi angry at Chaim The story disclosed that adults realize a long service is hard for a small boy to sit through but exercising selfrestraint and participating in communal rituals bring praise and acceptance from the community The analogies Mark drew between his own life and Chaims suggest that he had as his father intended experienced the story from a personal vantage point identifying with its events and applying them to himself Systematic research reveals both cultural similarities and dierences in adultchild narratives In an intensive observational study of daily storytelling in two communitiessix middleclass Chinese families in Taipei Taiwan and six middleclass American families in an IrishCatholic neighborhood in ChicagoPeggy Miller and her colleagues found that preschoolers and their family members routinely narrated past experiences Most often they created joint accounts of pleasurable holidays and family excursionsbirthday parties the fair the zoo and McDonalds for the American children the night market the zoo and riding on trains and horses for the Chinese children Both groups also talked about times the children were ill sad or frightened In a smaller set of narratives the topic addressedeither directly to the child or to someone else while the child listenedwas the childs misbehavior These stories more than any others seemed deliberately aimed at teaching social and moral standards Chinese parents however were far more likely to initiate these tales of misdeeds than were Americans In fact percent of Chinese adults narratives with or in the presence of yearold children focused on past transgressions whereas only percent of American narratives didFurthermore interpretations of childrens misbehavior diered between the two cultures Consistent with the Confucian parental obligation The deeper the love the greater the correction Chinese mothers misdeed stories were much longer than those of the American mothersin fact the most lengthy and elaborate of all Chinese narrations Sometimes they occurred right after the child committed a transgression at other times they reminded the child of earlier improper behavior Chinese mothers typically corrected the child repeatedly What did you say So what would you say Then how would Mom have reacted And in line with the Confucian reliance on formal stories with moral lessons these informal narratives often ended with direct teaching of how to act Saying dirty words is not good and after the child agreed an expression of aectiona hug a tender touchIn instances in which American stories referred to young childrens misbehavior mothers frequently deemphasized these acts attributing them to the childs spunk and assertiveness This does not mean that American parents seldom instruct their children in social and moral rules They often do so largely through guiding remarks that accompany childrens ongoing actions as in Dont grab Share the toy Hold hands when crossing the street You hurt Johnny Say youre sorryAs Miller notes the way social and moral lessons are integrated into narratives aects childrens frameworks for judging themselves and interpreting their social experiences Through everyday stories the Chinese adults personalized moral lessons and stressed obligations to parents and other authority gures They also reminded children of the impact of their transgressions on othersan element dramatically illustrated in one mothers recounting of her yearolds disruption of his older sisters music lesson Ai you made Mama lose face I wanted to dig my head into the ground Right Child smiles shakes head American narratives rarely dwelt on misdeeds and at times even recast childrens oenses as strengthsas indicative of quick thinking and an active spirited disposition Miller describes the generally high selfcontrol the Chinese children in these families displayedlistening attentively to elders and complying without reminders For example even at age they waited patiently to open a small gift until a guest had departedproper etiquette in Chinese culture Of course this does not mean that Americans ought to change their childoriented narratives to be just like those of the Chinese The socializing impact of a particular narrative style is strengthened by its consistency with a familys and communitys way of life Also the narrative variations we have considered tap only a small slice of cultural diversity in adultchild storytelling The most important lesson we can take from Millers provocative ndings is that when parents and teachers take time to construct narratives with and about the young child they create a zone that spurs children to weave moral and social rules into their selfdenitions and to behave accordinglyUnderstanding People as Mental Beings We have seen that talking about mental states is a major focus of narrative conversation In narrative we express the folk psychology of our cultureour deeply ingrained assumptions about human desires emotions and beliefs and our judgments of certain ones as more acceptable than others Indeed violations of our folk psychology are a major impetus for engaging in narrative Through conversing with others we try to make puzzling events and behaviors understandableBecause peoples desires feelings and beliefs often dier conversations are full of social negotiationsattempts to reconcile dierent versions of reality Recall how I suggested to my distraught friend that her daughters breakup with her anc might have been defensible given problems in the relationship and the daughters willingness to compensate the young man for his monetary losses Similarly a yearold who says that the sun disappearing below the horizon is sleepy is likely to receive an alternative explanation And as parents recount the misdeeds of their children the children gain access to others evaluations of their egocentric inconsiderate acts According to psychologist Jerome Bruner learning to negotiate diering viewpoints through narrative is a crowning achievement of human development Conversations about personal experiences are prime sources of social stability When outoftheordinary events occur and we experience clashing views we often look for a good listenera friend or a loved one we can talk to By collaborating with this partner in conversation we talk out our perspective seek our partners view search for meaning in seemingly chaotic events and try to reconstruct a comprehensible world In these conversations we may not agree with our partners point of view but we usually acknowledge that we comprehend and appreciate itand our partner generally does the same By joining in conversation and listening to the narrative dialogues of others children develop an understanding of their own and others rich mental lives Children with a good grasp of mental life can detect the likely inner causes of another persons behavior and use that information to anticipate what that person might do next Such children are also more adept at empathizingreading others emotions and vicariously experiencing thema response that increases the chances that they will react with sympathetic concern and help others in need As early as to years of age emotion knowledgeawareness of the circumstances that prompt dierent emotional reactions and the social consequences of expressing ones feelingsis related to friendly considerate behavior willingness to make amends after harming another and peer acceptanceResearch veries that the more families talk about inner states the greater childrens knowledge of them For example mothers who frequently label and explain emotions have preschoolers who use more emotion words in conversation Maternal prompting of emotional thoughts What makes him afraid is a good predictor of yearolds emotion language Later in the preschool years explanations Hes sad because his dog ran away are more predictive Consistent with Vygotskys concept of the zone sensitive parents adjust the way they talk about emotions to t childrens increasing competence And in line with what we have said about narrative as a vital context for negotiating diering viewpoints discussions in which family members disagree about feelings seem particularly helpful in prompting children to step back from the experience of emotion and reect on its causes and consequencesAttaining a Subtle Grasp of Mental Life Around age to childrens understanding of mental life undergoes a profound transformation Older preschoolers realize that peoples beliefs not just their desires aect their behavior This advance is apparent in childrens awareness that people can hold false beliefs To test for a childs grasp of false belief researchers present situations like this one Show a child two small closed boxes one a familiar BandAid box and the other a plain unmarked box Then say Pick the box that you think has the BandAids in it Almost always children pick the marked container Next ask the child to look inside both boxes when she does contrary to her own belief she will nd that the marked one is empty and the unmarked one contains the BandAids Finally introduce the child to a hand puppet and explain Heres Pam She has a cut see Where do you think shell look for BandAids Why would she look in there Only a handful of yearolds but many yearolds can explain why Pam would look in the marked box Because she thinks theres BandAids in it but there arent anyMastery of false belief shows that children regard beliefs as interpretations not just reections of reality It marks the transition toward a more complex active view of the mind which will ourish over the next few yearsthe realization that people can engage in a great many inner activities from concentrating remembering and understanding to guessing comparing and inferring Before age most children assume that physical experience determines mental experiencethat if BandAids are in the unmarked box everyone will just know where they are But preschoolers who grasp false belief recognize that people can on the basis of prior knowledge and experience interpret the same event dierentlyan understanding that is invaluable for social life Children who are good at detecting others points of view are better at thinking of eective ways to handle dicult social situations Rather than just asserting their own desires they try friendly persuasion Or they suggest that a conict be solved by creating new mutual goalsLike emotion knowledge preschoolers grasp of false belief grows out of conversations that touch on the mental lives of others Without those conversations this level of insight is slow to develop The Junn Quechua language of the Peruvian highlands is unique in lacking words that describe mental states such as think and believe so Quechua adults refer to mentality indirectly For example they use the phrase What would he say in place of What would he think Junn Quechua children have diculty with falsebelief tasks for years after children in industrialized nations have mastered them Furthermore clear evidence exists that preschoolers who frequently interact with more competent cultural membersparents extended family members neighbors older siblings and older peersare advanced in falsebelief reasoning These social encounters oer children many opportunities to hear people refer to their own mental states and those of others and therefore to observe dierent points of view When and yearolds use their newfound capacity to talk about mental states during play with friends their understanding of false belief improves further Finally as children participate in narratives and listen to those of others they acquire culturally accepted ways for negotiating clashing viewpoints This equips them with skills for engaging in conversation without confrontation and persistent conictcompetencies that are crucial for sustaining warm pleasurable social relationships Gratifying social ties in turn serve as vital contexts for further cognitive and social development Preparing for Literacy Most parents hope that during the preschool years their children will develop the knowledge skills and attitudes that prepare them to read and write in elementary school This interest in literacy is well founded Reading and writing are not just crucial for success in academic endeavors and later life They are thoroughfares to vast realms of knowledge enjoyable leisure pursuits and contact with others at a distanceeven in dierent historical time periods Once children can read and write they can explore the insights of countless authors and partake in their rich array of experiences With those authors they can forge highly varied and vastly expanded zones for learningChildren can become competent readers and writers without being trained pushed or goaded into literacy learning in early childhood As we saw earlier preschools and kindergartens that emphasize drill on academic skills are detrimental This way of teaching induces inattentiveness restlessness disengagement from challenging activities and poorer achievement during the rst few years of elementary school Young children who are enthusiastic and selfcondent about learning and who achieve at their best in the early grades have acquired literacyrelevant knowledge informallythrough exposure to books and other reading materials at home in preschool and in childcare environments through observing adults reading and writing in everyday life and especially through narrative conversation Literacyrelated behaviors emerge in these contexts consequently early childhood educators refer to preschool competencies that lay the foundation for reading and writing as emergent literacy Indeed no clear dividing line exists between prereading and reading As literacy experts Grover Whitehurst and Christopher Lonigan put it Reading writing and oral language develop concurrently and interdependently from an early age from childrens exposure to interactions in social contexts in which literacy is a component and in the absence of formal instructionResearch consistently demonstrates that language development in early childhood is strongly related to later reading competenceand to academic achievement in general during elementary school Furthermore both language progress and an array of emergentliteracy skills can be predicted by the sheer amount of verbal interaction in the home during the rst few years of lifea relationship that holds for children of all socioeconomic levels Conversations with adults are especially powerful contributors to early childhood language prociency and in turn to literacy developmentA strong language foundation is vital for becoming literate because people read to extract meaning Children can more easily derive meaning from the printed page when their vocabularies are large and they have come to think in ways that resemble the narrative styles on which the large majority of written texts are based By repeatedly listening to and participating in narrative conversation children develop mental scripts for the way narratives are typically organized Then when they start to read the organization of text material readily makes sense to them and they extract meaning more easily One of the clearest indicators of young childrens understanding of stories and other prereading skills is the extent to which they can give elaborate detailed accounts of past events Children sharpen this competency through conversing with adults who add information ask questions and prompt children to increase the sophistication of their descriptions and explanationsin essence who use an elaborative style of narrative talk Whitehurst and his colleagues have encouraged parents and teachers of young children to integrate the elaborative narrative style into shared adultchild storybook reading an approach called dialogic reading Typically an adult reads while a child listensa format that is benecial to early literacy development but that cannot guarantee the childs attention involvement and comprehension In dialogic reading the adult encourages the child to become a participant in the narrative even a storyteller Using books with pictures that convey a story line but that have limited text so the adult is less likely to revert to straight reading the parent or teacher has the child relate much of the story The adult assumes the role of an active listenerquerying encouraging and expanding on what the child has to say As in other narrative talk the adult increases the complexity of his or her questioning to t the childs language progress For and yearolds questions focus mostly on describing events actions and objects For and yearolds questions more often address narrative organization What happens next How does the story end analyses of characters Why did the little girl want a teddy bear and connections between the book and the childs everyday life Have you ever seen a re engine on its way to a re When parents and teachers use dialogic reading consistently over several weeks to several months children show gains in language development print knowledge and writing progress that are still present six months to a year later Although children dier widely in intrinsic interest in reading activities shared reading can spark the interest of children who seldom seek out literacyrelated pursuits on their own Aspects of adult behaviorwarmth dramatic quality and attempts to get the child to participate activelyheighten childrens interest and involvement in reading An interested child is more likely to request shared reading times notice features of print that are important for reading ask questions about them and later on read on his or her own As older preschoolers begin to attend to features of print adults can combine shared book reading with scaolding of childrens knowledge of letter names lettersound correspondences and print conventions for example that books are read from left to right and top to bottom of the page that spaces are used to separate words and periods to end sentences Adults can also assist young children as they become interested in writing by responding positively to their writinglike creations and helping them attain their writing goals in daily activities and playprinting their name or a message making a storybook or adding items to a shopping list Along with general language and narrative competencies relaxed informal teaching of basic reading and writing skillsin limited doses and without excessive feedback about right and wrongfosters emergent literacy and aids the process of learning to read and write after children begin school In sum adultchild conversationin bookreading and other contextsis the best way to prime young children for becoming interested accomplished readers and writers Shared reading with parents is particularly inuentialmore so than reading with teachers In one study Lonigan and Whitehurst compared shared reading with teachers at preschool shared reading with parents at home and a combined condition All three groups gained in oral language skills compared to children receiving no intervention But children experiencing home reading improved the most Parents seem to be in the best position to read to their child often and to tailor their dialogues to the childs interests and abilitiesOther Contexts for Joint AdultChild Engagement When parents and children spend time together opportunities for scaolding of new skills and for conversation are nearly limitless Parents who capitalize on these moments ensure that their children internalize the history values knowledge skills habits practices and understandings of their families and communities We have already seen how academically related tasks family celebrations family outings and adultchild storybook reading are excellent focal points for adultchild engagement Makebelieve play is yet another Indeed joint participation in makebelieve with more expert cultural members is so important for development during early childhood that I devote an entire chapter to it Other vital contexts for adultchild engagement include everyday routines and duties mealtimes and television viewing Each of these settings has distinct and highly signicant developmental benets as long as adults take time to enter into them and mentally connect with children everyday routines and dutiesBy participating in everyday routines and duties at home and in preschool children develop a sense of responsible participation in family and community life At the same time they acquire practical skills and a wealth of knowledge about their physical and social surroundings The parent always in a hurrywho says when the child desires involvement There isnt time or who fails to insist that the child join in household tasks in keeping with his or her capacityseverely limits the childs learningIn preindustrial times children spent most of their day alongside parents as they went about housekeeping and earning a livelihood As a result children became deeply familiar with adults daily activities picking up many skills through observation and direct participation Recall John Ises account of family life on a rural Kansas homestead described in Chapter Greater parentchild togetherness throughout the day is also common in tribal and village societies where adults spend less time supporting childrens learning through verbal scaolding because children have so many opportunities to observe and participate directly in the work of adultsBecause netuned scaolding is seldom required adultchild participation in everyday routines and dutiespreparing a meal washing dishes raking and bagging leaves in the garden buying groceriesoers extra time for conversation with all its attendant benets In addition many informal learning opportunities arise that will serve children well when they get to school An astute mother I observed in the grocery store had her yearold son Ricky reach for items on the shelf and put them in the cart When at the checkout counter Ricky became restless and whiny his mother handed him her credit card and directed him to watch closely for the moment the clerk would need it As the boy turned toward the register the mother pointed out how the price of each item appeared on a screen Ricky alternately named the numbers he recognized and counted items as they passed through the checkout Awed by the responsibility of handing over the credit card a task he had seen performed only by adults Ricky complied eagerlyand also saw numerical concepts in action Although grocery shopping with Ricky might take or minutes longer than otherwise it has wideranging benets for his developmentChildren as parents and teachers well know are not always eager to perform chores that adults set for them But they are more willing when they see adults engaged in those duties when adults explain why its fair that everyone help and when their relationship with those adults is warm and gratifying These communicative ingredients motivate children to join in with a cooperative spirit which demonstrates that they have moved beyond the adults position to one of their ownthat is internalized social norms with conviction In doing so young children demonstrate once again their strong desire to become part of cultural lifemealtime conversationsMealtimesusually dinnerare special social contexts for families in complex societies They are among the few occasions in which parents and children regularly gather after spending most of the day apart and in which the main family activity is relating to one another Hence mealtime talk overows with opportunities for socialization Mealtimes and similar occasions for family togetherness open special conversational doors Because all family members are present dinner talk can convey to children a sense of family coherence and identity Most of us can still recapture the stories our parents told us in which social and moral lessons were powerful and abundant Here is one my mother told me recalled in vivid detail nearly a half century later Once when your grandfather was years old he came home weeping his hands all bloody from working in the factory His mother your great grandmother wiped away his tears and said Dont cry one day youll own that factory And by the time he was he didDinnertime recaps of daily events also permit todays children isolated from the adult world of real work to gain access to their parents daily lives I learned much about my fathers experiences as a retail merchant through stories he related to my mother at dinnertime Soe youll never believe the customer who came into the store today She complained so vehemently about a perfectly correct bill that it took two of us to escort her to the door Family mealtime conversations whether children participate directly or listen to the exchanges of others also provide special instruction in discussion skills since they are among the few routine occasions in which children are permitted to enter an adult conversational world When meals are shared with children parents can model and teach cultural rules regulating conversationappropriate topics and politeness We dont say food is disgusting at the table and subtle conversational strategies that children become procient at only after much practice such as how to enter a conversation and link with other participants statementsFinally and perhaps most important mealtimes allow parents to enter into their childrens world and hear about the many facets of their lives ranging from what the child did at school that day to reections on how to solve peer or sibling problems Consequently they serve to reinforce not just socialization but parental caring and support The numerous benets of this rich communal context are lost when family mealtime rituals diminish or disintegrate into frequent eating on the run or split adultchild meals The importance of family mealtimes is underscored by the fact that the most widely used research instrument for assessing the quality of young childrens home environments asks parents whether the child eats at least one meal a day with a parent Scores on that instrument consistently predict early childhood mental development no matter what the childs socioeconomic or ethnic backgroundtelevision viewingIn Chapter I noted that according to current survey ndings American adults spend over onethird of their free timeabout hours per weekwatching TV Estimates for children are even more ominous Regular TV viewing typically begins between and years of age consuming about hours per week or nearly percent of the childs waking hours It rises steadily over early childhood until it reaches an average of hours per week for schoolage children or about percent of the childs waking hours When we consider how much the set is on during school holidays and summer vacations children spend more time watching TV than they do in any other waking activity including going to school and interacting with family members or peers These statistics are averages children dier in their attraction to television For example parents who watch a lot of TV tend to have children who do the same Excessive TV viewing is associated with family and peer diculties poor school achievement and serious health concernsspecically overweight and obesity as a result of hours of being sedentary and eating highfat snacks while viewing Parents with stressful unhappy lives often escape into television and their children may do so as wellIt is crucial that parents exercise their gatekeeper role with respect to TV limiting how much and what young children watchto about an hour to an hourandahalf a day and to programs that are childappropriate and informative and that teach positive social attitudes and behaviors In addition as much as possible parents should watch with children and engage in joint conversation about televised information helping them understand what they see Parental oversight and involvement in childrens TV viewing are essential for two reasons First preschoolers easily misunderstand televised material For example at ages and they do not discriminate TV images from real objects they say a bowl of popcorn on TV would spill if the set were turned upside down When a child believes that all people objects and events on TV are authentic violenceso pervasive on American TVbecomes particularly terrifying Although by age children know that not all TV programming is real they judge TV reality according to whether the images resemble people and objects in everyday life Not until age do children fully grasp the unreality of TV ctionthat characters do not retain their roles outside the TV show Furthermore prior to this age children have diculty inferring characters motives and connecting contradictory TV scenes into a coherent story line They cannot appreciate why a character who at rst seemed like a good guy but later behaves aggressively is really a bad guy They evaluate such characters and their actions much too favorably For example psychologist Sharon Purdie showed second graders a complex dramatic program in which an accused kidnapper who had at rst appeared friendly tried to shoot a prosecution witness and got arrested during the attempt Children who failed to grasp the kidnappers motive and the reason for the arrest judged him to be good not badSecond weak government regulation of American TV means that without parental controls child viewers are exposed repeatedly to antisocial attitudes and behaviors The average American child nishing elementary school has seen more than televised violent acts that provide an extensive howto course in aggressionTelevision also hardens children to violence making them more willing to tolerate it in others Furthermore although educational programming for children is highly sensitive to issues of equity and diversity entertainment programming often conveys ethnic and gender stereotypesminorities as villains and victims of violence and in subservient roles men as dominant powerful and competent and women as attractive emotional and submissive The more children view the more likely they are to endorse such stereotypes Finally as many parents are aware television advertising manipulates childrens beliefs and preferences Although children can distinguish a TV program from a commercial as early as age below age they seldom grasp the selling purpose of the ads Rather they think that commercials are wellintentioned eorts to be helpful to viewersThese worrisome ndings are not an inherent part of the TV medium Instead they result from the way it is used in American culture In actuality television has as much potential for good as it does for ill For example TV content depicting acts of cooperating helping and comforting encourages these behaviors in children But most of the time programs mix benevolent and hostile intentions in the same character Unfortunately children are riveted by a characters aggression and miss the caring message Television promotes positive social behavior in young children only when it is free of violent contentDespite widespread public concern about the impact of TV on childrens development many parents do little to regulate or guide their childrens viewing When parents do make an eort preschoolers watch less TV nd educational programs more appealing and more often view shows with their parents Parentchild coviewing creates conditions in which adults can raise questions about the realism of televised information assist children in making sense of the story line and express disapproval of negative onscreen behavior and commercial messages thereby teaching children to evaluate TV content rather than to accept it uncriticallyInterestingly parents who are warm communicative and rm but appropriate in their expectations have children who are less drawn to TV particularly violent TV Very likely these parents set an example through their own TV viewing watch with their children whenever they can and use TV programs in constructive ways helping children move away from the set into worthwhile activities A program about animals for example might spark a weekend trip to the zoo a visit to the library for books about animals or new ways of observing and caring for the family pet Parents who intervene in their childs TV viewing so it is in keeping with the zone transform the TV medium from a negative to a positive force in the childs mental life and they promote favorable cognitive and social development in many other ways as well dialogues with children larger implicationsCompared to two or three generations ago contemporary parents and children less often engage in the developmentenhancing joint activities discussed throughout this chapter In long before parents became preoccupied with the time bind psychologist Urie Bronfenbrenner reected that children used to be brought up by their parents Although the family Bronfenbrenner noted continues to have primary responsibility for childrens character development it lacks the strength needed to do the job because parents and children no longer spend enough time together Ours is a split societyadults in one world children in another Too many families have separate adultchild living areas each equipped with its own TV and other leisure pursuits so that parentchild dialogues seldom take place When parents and children spend most of their time apart the result is a profound dampening of parents socializing power In the past extended family members or adults in the neighborhood more readily stepped in when parents for one reason or another could not invest enough time in their childrens lives Today neighborhood experiences are much more restricted Housing enclaves where families know each other well and interested adults are available to mind childrens business are rare Children who live close to their grandparents benet greatly enjoying aectionate playful relationships with them at early ages and looking to them for information role models family history and values later on But greater family mobility means that more children live a considerable distance from grandparents and other relatives And parental divorce which will aect to percent of American children born in the current decade lessens contact with the noncustodial parents extended family In childhood physical distance makes for a psychologically distant relationshipRemove parents and other adults from active participation in the lives of young children and the vacuum may be lled by unsupervised and illbehaved peers and the moral vagaries of American TV fare Continued disengagement of adults from childrens lives Bronfenbrenner prophesied will result in greater alienation indierence antagonism and violence on the part of young people from all sectors of societya prediction that came to pass in the form of rapidly escalating youth crime between the s and s with an increasing number of oenders from privileged homes As media analysts try to make sense of the most heinous of these acts including the recent spate of family school and neighborhood murders and maimings parental retreat from a troubled childs life almost invariably surfaces as a contributing factor Parents of these youngsters often appear to be good people having provided their children with material comforts and having responded with anguish remorse and attempts to do the right thing in the face of their childs previous and current grievous behavior But the cases suggest that stepping in only in at times of crisis cannot compensate for providing the ongoing togetherness and haven of a family Such togetherness aects a childs development in countless ways even through what appear to be triing pursuitshelp with homework outings to the grocery store the park and the local library dinnertime conversations discussions of exciting or scary TV shows and bedtime stories Yet these are the key experiences of childhood through which children appropriate mental tools from more capable and discerning social partners become enculturated and thereby humanintelligent responsible and caring Of course most youngsters with preoccupied parents do not become antisocial and violent Yet over and over commentary in the media and in the psychological literature conrms that too many of our youth are disaected in less intense waysselfabsorbed disgruntled and lacking a clear sense of direction and purpose In the words of psychologist William Damon they are demoralized a term that suggests a break with their social world a deciency in internalization of worthwhile values and goals A provocative question is whether a craving for connection with family and community is at the heart of the oundering of many of todays youth manifested in academic problems poor peer relationships low selfesteem depression angry actingout behavior andwith the arrival of young adulthoodinability to make vocational commitments attain nancial independence and forge healthy intimate relationships Research documents that these diculties are magnied two to threefold in children and adolescents who have been exposed to marital discord and divorce circumstances in which parentsat odds with one anotherall too often are diverted from investing in their childrens daytoday lives Yet a certain number of children and adolescents despite exposure to severe family adversity escape these diculties and adjust well A common element in the lives of such resilient youngsters as I noted in Chapter is an unusually warm positive relationship with at least one parent or a close tie with an adult outside the immediate family What happens within these alternative relationships that shields the young person from problems or restores eective functioning Although little systematic evidence exists on the precise ingredients of such ties I recently became familiar with the bond forged between Hannah a yearold college student and her Aunt Eva and Uncle Charlie two of my university colleagues Hannahs parents divorced when she was and her older sister Sarah was Hannah related the story of her childhood and the genesis of her relationship with Eva and Charlie who oered insights as well What they had to say is enlightening I cant remember much family togetherness when I was a kid Hannah remarked Our parents couldnt talk things out with each other and they rarely talked things out with us Mom took Sarah and me to Girl Scouts swimming piano and other lessons We enjoyed the activities and the friends we made but they couldnt compensate for what was missing warm family time We almost never sat down to a meal together or went places together we each went our own way Our dad started going o on vacations by himself when holidays rolled around so family gettogethers were rare When our parents split up we moved with our mom from Arkansas to Seattle Mom worked all week weekends and most evenings She had to get a career going so thered be money to live on and to send us to college Sarah hung out with another family in the neighborhood A couple of times a week she had dinner and went to church with them Looking back Id say they were her substitute family she adopted them and they adopted her I was too young to go o on my own that way When I didnt have afterschool activities Mom insisted that I come home and do chores and homework Sometimes I got to go to a friends house to play but many nights Id open a can of spaghetti and have dinner by myself I spent hours daydreaming and looking at old pictures of Mom Dad Sarah and meOn nishing high school Sarah chose a religiously aliated college of the same denomination as that of her alternative family The year after her college graduation Sarah married a devout classmate entering into a culture in which family life was pivotal Six years later Hannah started college but for her the road to maturity was rough She had diculty concentrating earned uneven grades and accumulated so many incompletes in courses that the university prohibited her from reenrolling until she wrapped up her unnished business Frustrated with Hannahs undirectedness her mother withdrew nancial support and insisted that she get a job Hannahs fulltime waitressing soon became both an obstacle and an excuse for lack of progress in her studies I was at sea Hannah recalled I didnt have any condence in myself and I didnt think I could do anything So I started visiting Aunt Eva and Uncle Charlie who lived three hours awayWe hadnt known Hannah well while she was growing up Eva continued so we were surprised but delighted when she started coming on weekends It didnt matter what we were doingbirthday celebrations dinner with friends outings to movies and plays shopping excursions or leisurely breakfasts Hannah hungered to be part of our family During those times she asked lots of questions about our work and home lives and also about her parents especially their early history Was my mom close to her mom Did you know my mom and dad when they were in college What was my parents wedding like I described these and many other earlier events We also did our best to convince Hannah that believing in herself grows out of trying hard taking risks and following through We talked about how important it was for her to return to school helped her think through a change of major and advised on time management and study skillsHannah completed her degree the following year In a letter she wrote to Eva and Charlie shortly after her graduation she attributed her turnabout in motivation and selfcondence to the connection forged through dialogue with her aunt and uncleThank you for everything you have provided the time and eort you shared with me and the condence you showed in me It denitely enabled me to relocate all of that within myself this year and even be pleasantly surprised by how each accomplishment facilitates the next one This and you are among the greatest gifts I have ever received The change in my ability to focus on my courses and the personal rewards have been immense THANKS What factors contributed to Hannahs turnabout Shared understanding intersubjectivity between adult and child scaolding of new competencies narrative conversations prompting a redenition of self and joint engagement in culturally meaningful activitiesthe diverse experiences we have considered that create the zone of proximal developmentappear to be at the heart of her success story Indeed Hannahs tale suggests that young children denied these supports can still prot from them later if such supports are available and they have the fortitude to capitalize on them But not all young people are as fortunate as Hannah Some remain profoundly impaired by inadequate adult investment in their childhoods And even those who fare reasonably well may carry with them inner woundsa sense of emptiness and regret at having missed selfdening condenceinducing early experiences that cannot in the nal analysis be recapturedExperts asked to reect on the malaise and problematic behavior of children today repeatedly comment that they lack sucient adult guidance and involvement We have seen that children come into the world marvelously prepared to enter into partnerships with parents and other caregivers In the course of this chapter I have had much to say about just how parents and teachers can capitalize on childrens natural propensities Vygotskys concept of the zone claries for us the meaning of true quality time What must we do to keep young children in the zone motivated involved and ever advancing to new heights Here is a brief recap of the communicative principles we have consideredForge an adultchild relationship based on shared understanding or intersubjectivityone in which the adult strives to connect with the child by stretching down to his or her point of view thereby helping the child stretch up to the adults more mature perspective Intersubjectivity is essential for all successful dialogueOer a scaffold for mastery of tasks that teach culturally valued concepts and skills Adjust the task to an appropriately challenging level and tailor teaching and assistance to the childs changing needs While supporting the childs eorts ask questions and suggest strategies that help the child generate ideas and distance his or her thinking from the immediate features of the task Turn over responsibility for the task to the child as soon as he or she can master it without assistance Adultchild collaboration through scaolding promotes selfregulation and independent accomplishmentCommunicate with high warmth using a positive emotional tone and providing explanations and justications for your expectations When adultchild relationships are sympathetic and caring children want to acquire skills and behave in ways that preserve those gratifying ties They are also more willing to work toward goals that are rational and reasonable Authoritative parenting which combines the motivating power of warmth with the guidance inherent in scaolding predicts many aspects of childrens competenceEngage children in narrative conversation about personal experiences using an elaborative conversational style that poses many varied questions and that expands on the childs statements Through narrative children build an autobiographical self permeated with cultural beliefs and values come to understand that people have rich mental lives and may view the same events dierently and acquire negotiation strategies for resolving disputes and getting along with others Narrative conversation also fosters language development and emergent literacy which greatly ease the task of learning to read and write when children get to school Through dialogues with children adults play a formative role in the development of childrens selfconceptions sensitivity to others cognition academic knowledge morality social skills and capacity to use language to gain control over thought and behavior Can parents and teachers actually witness young children undergoing these socialtopsychological transformations Lets turn now to a consideration of childrens inner mental lives as manifested in the dialogues they carry on with themselves In the next chapter I address a question that has long intrigued child development theorists and puzzled many parents and teachers Why do children talk to themselves Two days a week Kevin leaves his office minutes early to take charge of his yearold daughter Sophie while her mother a university professor teaches a late class One balmy spring afternoon Kevin retrieved Sophie at her childcare center and drove the minute route home Invited to look in on Sophies play I met the pair at the front door and nestled into a rocking chair from which to observe unobtrusivelyAfter downing the last bite of her snack Sophie grabbed Kevins hand and led him across the family room to a rug lined on two sides by shelves lled with books stuffed animals and other play props Sophie moved a toy horse and cow inside a small enclosed fence that she and Kevin had put together the day before Then she turned the animals on their sides and moved them toward each otherWhy are horse and cow lying down Kevin askedCause theyre tired Sophie answered pushing the two animals closer togetherOh yes Kevin affirmed Then building on Sophies theme he placed a teddy bear on another part of the rug and offered I think Teds tired too Im going to start a bed over here for some other animalsSophie turned toward the teddy bear lifted his paw and exclaimed She wants a lollipop to hold in her handA lollipop in her hand We havent got any lollipops have we answered KevinLaura has declared Sophie glancing at meHas Laura got a lollipop Kevin queriedYes Shes got all of those and a swing and a table too Sophie remarked referring to my chair which rocked back and forth next to an end tableMaybe this could be a makebelieve lollipop suggested Kevin placing a round piece on the end of a long TinkerToy stick and handing the structure to SophieThats a lollipop agreed Sophie placing it in the paw of the teddy bearCan she suck that while shes going off to sleep asked Kevin Do you think thats what she wantsIts a pacier explained Sophie renaming the objectA pacier do you think The pacier might help her get to sleep Kevin conrmedThis long long pacier Sophie answered picking up the TinkerToy structure looking at its long stick and pausing as if to decide what to do nextLeprechaun is looking pretty tired suggested Kevin laying Sophies stuffed leprechaun next to the teddy bear What do you thinkHe wants a lollipop tooOh he wants a lollipop as well What are we going to use for a lollipop for the leprechaun asked KevinPressing the teddy bears and the leprechauns arms together and the lollipopturnedpacier between them Sophie readily came up with a solution Hes sharing she affirmedOh theyll share All right Kevin agreedThis scene is but a small excerpt from Sophie and Kevins joint play session which persisted for more than an houra remarkably long time for a yearold to sustain any activity Yet when the TV set is switched off and children are free to do as they choose most preschoolers readily become absorbed in pretending At times their involvement is so intense that on being interrupted they react with shock and dismay rejecting an adult who otherwise would be welcomed with joy and affection One mother reported to me that her daughter Mattie reserved the period after she awoke in the morning for conversing with dolls and other imaginary characters If a parent entered too soon to help her wash and dress she dismissed the intruder proclaiming sharply Busy Dont stop my dollies Only smooth and clever entry into the makebelieve activityfor example inviting the dolls and stuffed animals to get up for breakfastcould lure Mattie into starting the real part of her day without protestThe years of early childhood are often called the high season of imaginative play and aptly so since makebelieve blossoms during this time evolving from simple imitative acts into highly elaborate imaginative plots involving complex coordination of roles Eminent child development theorists of the past attached great importance to the role of makebelieve play in early development All were convinced that anything so compelling and engrossing in the life of the young child must be profoundly signicantthe role of makebelieve play in childrens livesAmong inuential explanations of why preschoolers are so drawn to pretending Freuds psychoanalytic theory and Piagets cognitive theory held sway for much of the twentieth century Although each has made valuable contributions to our understanding a new more powerful view of the meaning of young childrens play has arrived on the scene thanks to Vygotskys sociocultural theoryThe Psychoanalytic View Wish Fulfillment and Insight into Social RolesFreud regarded makebelieve play as a form of pleasurable wish fulllment that allows children to act out uncertainties anxieties and hoped for outcomes and therefore to master frightening and frustrating events Young children Freud noted often revisit anxietyprovoking experiences such as a trip to the doctors office or discipline by a parent but with roles reversed so the child is in command and compensates for unpleasant happenings Sophies parents aware of the previous days events might have judged her pretend focus on bedtime lollipops and paciers to contain at least an element of wish fulllment The evening before they had told her Only one lolly from the candy dish and she had complained at having to go to bed while her parents continued to talk and laugh with their guestsPsychoanalyst Erik Erikson built on Freuds vision expanding his picture of makebelieve According to Erikson children draw on fantasy play to nd out about themselves and their social world In all cultures children act out family roles and highly visible occupationspolice officer doctor and nurse in our society rabbit hunter and potter among the Hopi Indians and hut builder and spear maker among the Baka of West Africa As they do so they enter a small social organization whose members must cooperate to achieve common goals And through observing and emulating admired adult gures preschoolers internalize social norms and gain a sense of their future of what they can become and how they can contribute to society Piagets View Exercising a New Symbolic CapacityPiaget acknowledged the emotional function of play and he agreed that through pretending children become familiar with socialrole possibilities But he is best known for stressing the symbolic nature of makebelieve Pretending Piaget pointed out is a vital means of mentally representing the world that along with gestures language and drawings develops rapidly in early childhood Through it children practice and strengthen their capacity to represent their experiences For example when Sophie pretended to put the animals to bed and used a TinkerToy to stand for a lollipop she represented in her mind what formerly she could experience only directlyby going to bed or sucking a lollipop Practicing and solidifying modes of representation Piaget emphasized make it possible for the child to free thought from the here and now create larger images of reality that take into account past present and future and transform those images mentally in the service of logical thinking Nevertheless Piaget was convinced that by itself makebelieve play does little to advance childrens development Rather children merely exercise playfully the symbols they have acquired in other contexts Much like his view of private speech as egocentric and nonsocial Piaget believed that at rst pretend play is a solitary activity in which the child uses highly personal symbols that cannot easily be interpreted by others Sociodramatic play involving joint makebelieve with a partner Piaget claimed is not under way until age As with other aspects of Piagets theory the direction of development for makebelieve is from purely individual egocentric symbols to social play and shared understandingYet think back to yearold Sophies pretending Sophie is socially engaged throughout From the start she draws Kevin into the activity explains her pretend actions so he can build on them and responds cooperatively and appropriately to Kevins suggestions as he does to hers Vygotskys theory has been the wellspring of our recent appreciation of the profoundly social nature of even very young childrens imaginative playand its wideranging inuence on cognitive and social developmentVygotskys View A Zone of Proximal DevelopmentVygotsky viewed makebelieve play as crucial in childrens learning He regarded it as a unique broadly inuential zone in which children try out a wide variety of challenging skills and acquire many culturally valued competencies Consider the following frequently quoted remarks taken from a brief lecture in which Vygotsky eloquently summed up his conviction that pretend play is a central force in childrens developmentMakebelieve play creates a zone of proximal development in the child In play the child always behaves beyond his average age above his daily behavior in play it is as though he were a head taller than himself As in the focus of a magnifying glass play contains all developmental tendencies in condensed form and is itself a major source of development Why did Vygotsky say that makebelieve play creates a zone in which the child is a head taller than himself If we stop every now and then to watch children at play we can see what Vygotsky meant Recall how Sophie satised both teddy bears and leprechauns desire for a lollipop when just one TinkerToy lollipop was available She had them share a very mature response for a yearold In everyday life Sophie like many Western children her age nds sharing to be difficult As another illustration consider yearold David who has trouble sitting still during group storytime in kindergarten He leans over and talks to the other children In spite of the teachers frequent prompting he cant stay seated for more than a couple of minutes But when David plays school with several of his friends he can sit and pay attention for much longerperhaps as long as minutes Play provides the roles rules and scenarios that enable David to concentrate at a much higher level than he typically does in nonpretend contextsunique features of makebelieve playHow do the makebelieve scenes just described and others like them serve as major sources of development To answer this question Vygotsky pointed out we must identify the distinctive features of makebelieve playthose that make it unique among young childrens experiences The widespread belief originating with Freud that play is pleasurable wish fulllment characterizes certain playful pursuitsfor example acting out highstatus roles such as doctor parent or teacher and thereby exercising authority over others instead of being directed and controlled But not all fantasy qualies as wish fulllment In the sociodramatic scenarios that young children create a doctor must have patients to inoculate a parent must have children to discipline and a teacher must have pupils to do assignments Makebelieve roles are not equally pleasurablea feature of cooperation that is as true in everyday life as it is in fantasy play Even when makebelieve does fulll a childs wishes such pleasure is not unique to play Many other activities such as eating a favorite treat being granted the undivided attention and affection of a parent and listening to an exciting story are at least as gratifying and sometimes more so than pretending Indeed imaginative wish fulllment can at times be counterproductive In wellknown research on childrens ability to delay gratication psychologist Walter Mischel and his collaborators showed preschoolers some delicious marshmallows and told them that they could have one now or several if they waited until later Children who spent the waiting period in a wishfulllment mode thinking about what it would be like to eat those tasty marshmallows were far less likely to wait patiently and successfully than children who turned their attention away from the treats and thought about other things In this situation and others being caught up in fantasized wish fulllment interferes with attaining larger more rewarding outcomes in real lifeones that would have been realized had the child been able to exercise imaginative selfrestraint What about Piagets belief that through makebelieve young children solidify their new symbolic capacity A burgeoning ability to use symbols certainly contributes to the emergence of makebelieve and as well soon see makebelieve does much to extend young childrens symbolic skills Nevertheless mental representation is yet another feature that is not exclusive to play As we have already noted it also characterizes gestures language and artistic pursuits as well as beginning literacypreschoolers rst efforts to make sense of written symbolsVygotsky concluded that makebelieve play has two crucial features that distinguish it from other childhood activities First the creation of imaginary situations in play helps children separate internal ideas from the objects and events for which they stand Once young children realize that words gestures and other symbols are distinct from external reality they are well on the way to using those representations as effective mental tools calling on them to overcome impulses Second a careful look at childrens pretend scenarios reveals that makebelieve play is above all rulebased play Inspired by experiences in their families and communities children continually devise and follow social rules in imaginary situations In doing so they strive to bring their behavior in line with social expectations and acquire the rules of social life Consider these unique complementary ingredients of makebelieve The rst strengthens childrens internal capacity to become civilized and socially responsible The second provides children with powerful external pressures to act in socially desirable ways Together these features make fantasy play a supreme contributor to the development of selfregulationone that extends the impact of adult teaching and example more than any other early childhood activity To understand makebelieve plays role in development lets take a closer look at each of its unique featuresOvercoming Impulsive ActionFantasy play makes its appearance in the second year of life a time when children must start to suppress impulses and accept that certain desires will remain unsatised In infancy most of the childs wantsfor food stimulation affection and comfortare gratied quickly Such prompt satisfaction grants babies the security that their basic needs will be met As a result they do not have to be preoccupied with those needs and instead can turn their attention outward toward acquiring physical cognitive and social skills Warm responsive caregiving also promotes a view of parents as kind and compassionatean outlook essential for motivating children to emulate and take direction from parentsBetween and years of age children begin to acquire language greater understanding of the consequences of their actions and the ability to comply with others requests and directives Consequently caregivers expectations change They increasingly insist that children engage in socially appropriate conduct During the very period in which children must learn to subordinate their desires to social life imaginative play ourishes For Vygotsky this synchrony between socialization and makebelieve is no coincidence Pretend play forties childrens capacity to use ideas to guide behavior The young immature child runs after a ball that rolls into the street without considering consequences drops toys on the spot when another activity engages her and grabs an attractive object from a playmate without regard for the playmates rights and feelings Makebelieve play Vygotsky asserted helps preschoolers conquer these impulses by granting the child repeated practice in acting independently of what he seesJust how does imaginative play help children distinguish ideas from the enticing stimuli around them and use thought to guide behavior According to Vygotsky the object substitutions that permeate childrens makebelieve are crucial in this process While pretending children continually use one object to represent another By making a TinkerToy stand for a lollypop or a folded blanket stand for a sleeping baby children step back from reality The TinkerToy becomes a means for separating the idea lollipop from a real lollipop the blanket becomes a means for separating the idea baby from a real baby This severing of thought from objects and actions occurs because in play children change an objects usual meaning In calling the TinkerToy a lollipop Sophie conjured up the idea of a lollipop and used it to alter the TinkerToys identity As a result rather than reacting impulsively to the sight of a lollipop Sophie relied on ideas to regulate the lollipops very existenceand the teddy bears the leprechauns and her own actions toward itAt rst children nd it difficult to distinguish words and other mental symbols from the objects and actions to which they refer Parents seem to realize this when in the presence of their or yearold they phrase things this way to an adult companion After we nish running errands lets stop off for some ice cream Ask parents why they spell rather than say the words and they remark If you say ice cream hell want it now He wont be able to waitChildrens earliest efforts at makebelieve also reveal how challenging they nd the task of detaching thought from reality Initially object substitutions are closely tied to the real things they represent Toddlers between ages and generally use only realisticlooking objects while pretendinga toy telephone to talk into or a cup to drink from Once I handed a monthold a small wooden block put another to my ear and called her on the phone Ring Ring Hello Lynnay She responded by throwing down the block and turning to another activity Yet when given a plastic replica of a pushbutton phone Lynnay readily put the receiver to her ear and pretended to converseAround age children begin to pretend with less realistic toys such as a block for a telephone And sometime during the third year they can imagine objects and events with little or no support from the real world as when they say to a play partner Im calling Susie on the phone while dialing with their hands or without acting out the event at all Between ages and this detachment of makebelieve symbols from the reallife conditions they stand for is well developed Lets look in on yearold Alison as she draws her father into a makebelieve scenario Notice how Alisons imagination ranges far beyond the immediate play props before hera tea set a toy truck and an ambulance In the span of a few moments she conjures up a fantastic multicolored house and room and travels to a distant land where she witnesses a cataclysmic eventAlison while stacking multicolored plastic spoons I dont need my house painted It just got painted todayFather Just got painted todayAlison YepFather What color was it paintedAlison Its kind of its got brown and red in itFather Brown and redAlison And a little peach colorFather A little peach color What color is your bedroomAlison Well its yellow and orange and redFather That sounds prettyAlison All mixed togetherFather Oh all mixed togetherAlison Well I have a dump truck Orwhat else would you like An ambulance Picks up toy ambulance and hands it to her fatherFather Did someone get in an accidentAlison Well yes Then referring to a newspaper report her father had mentioned earlier in the day This morning it said changes to a lowpitched somber tone of voice Two trains crashingin IndiaVygotsky maintained that in detaching symbols from objects and actions makebelieve play helps children use thought to choose deliberately among alternative courses of behavior In play Alison thinks about paint colors which need not be the color of her real room She learns that you can consider possibilities and choose among them thereby controlling eventual outcomes Imaginative play Vygotsky noted also functions as a bridge from the concrete thought of the preschool and early school years to mature adult thought which can be totally free of real situations In helping children disengage thought from reality pretend play is vital preparation for the much later development of abstract thinking in which symbols are manipulated and hypothetical ideas are evaluated without referring to currently existing real world conditions When imagination eventually combines with the logical abstract reasoning powers of adolescence the stage is set for creativity A truly creative work is both original and sensible its novelty is culturally meaningful and useful Almost always creativity demands a high degree of selfregulationpulling together previously unrelated ideas critically evaluating those ideas and persevering in the face of obstacles In makebelieve Alison experimented with the rst step of this multistep process when she melded news of the train crash in India with the toy ambulance before her As we will see shortly people renowned for their creative accomplishments often report that makebelieve play was a frequent highly inuential aspect of their early developmentAcquiring and Enacting the Rules of Social LifeHad Vygotsky lived long enough to become familiar with Erik Eriksons psychoanalytic theory he would have agreed that makebelieve play teaches children about social roles and provides them with insights into what they can become in their society But Vygotsky was far more explicit about just how pretending helps children acquire dispositions that foster eager willing participation in social lifeChildrens imaginative play Vygotsky pointed out contains an interesting paradox In play preschoolers seem to do what they most feel like doing and to an outside observer their play appears free and spontaneous Nevertheless pretend play demands that children act against their immediate impulses because they must subject themselves to the rules of the makebelieve scene A child pretending to go to sleep follows the rules of bedtime behavior Another child imagining herself to be a mother and a doll to be a baby conforms to the rules of parental behavior And a child playing astronaut obeys the rules of shuttle launch and space walk In this sense makebelieve is not really free play as we often assume it to be Instead its very essence is selfrestraintvoluntarily following social rules While pretending Vygotsky explained children repeatedly face conicts between the rules of the makebelieve situation and what they would do if they could act impulsively and they usually decide in favor of the rules When tired Sophies teddy bear and leprechaun dont stay up late doing just as they please Instead they obey their caregivers and go to bed With only one lollipop or pacier to go around teddy bear and leprechaun share They dont quarrel and grab and if they had done so Sophie or another makebelieve character probably would have intervened and insisted on kind considerate behaviorAccording to Vygotsky childrens greatest selfcontrol occurs during makebelieve play They achieve their maximum display of willpower when at their own initiative they renounce a momentary attraction in favor of rulegoverned behavior The paradox of makebelieve is that in everyday life when children subordinate actions to rules they usually give up something they wantinstead of keeping a treasured toy all to themselves they share it instead of continuing to play they clean up instead of watching more TV they go to bed During fantasy play however renouncing impulse and following social rules are central to the fun of playing Rather than frustrating or disappointing the child selfrestraint is the route to maximum pleasure In sum subordinating immediate desires to the rules of makebelieve scenes becomes a new form of desireone that responds to the childs need to become an accepted member of his or her culture Indeed if you watch preschoolers at play you will see that they rarely violate the rules of their social world And as they jointly create play scripts and follow social rules with peers they come to appreciate societys norms and strive to uphold them A child playing storekeeper experiences rsthand the reasons for having customers line up to pay for making change accurately and for being polite A child playing parent in a household scene becomes aware of parental responsibilities and why its important for children to follow their parents directives In fact an adult who breaks a rule in makebelieve usually brings preschoolers profound respect for social order into bold relief Cara a demanding but spirited yearold likes to initiate makebelieve with the following transparent role reversal Mom Ill be the mother and you be my child years old Caras mother plays along for a while and then deliberately transgresses refusing to eat her vegetables or pick up her toys At the rst sign of misbehavior Cara lectures in a tone of voice well beyond her years Children must obey their parents because their parents know things they dont so the parents must take care of them As Caras pronouncement makes clear play creates a zone through which preschoolers internalize a basic sense of social responsibility and morality At the same time they acquire a wealth of practical knowledge and skills In extreme circumstances when the organization and predictability of the real world fall apart young children whose prior lives have been lled with parental warmth and involvement often call on rules and rituals in makebelieve to restore their social world Recently I came across the recollections of Alice Cahana an elderly Holocaust survivor recounting her days as a child in the death camp at Auschwitz Alice explained that she and her sister Edith managed despite all odds to stay together Their secret strategy was never to display any emotion that would give away their relationship since a major objective of the SS was to break up families Only at night did they dare to hug whisper and play together On Friday nights they marked the Sabbath in a special way by imagining that they were at home They talked about the evenings events in minute detail to make the image of family life rm and real Alice had always had the responsibility of setting the table and her mother would correct her if she left out even small nonessential items In play Edith would murmur Alice its time to set the table Find the nicest tablecloths and dont forget the owers Where are the napkins for the guests You forgot the fork for Father You really shined the candelabra beautifully this week better than before After their pretend meal the two sisters would whisper songsThe rules of makebelieve kept alive the integrity of the girls lost social world They kindled hope or as Alice put it an inner light fortifying the children with the selfrestraint and forbearance they needed to endure the next day from makebelieve play to organized games with rulesVygotsky regarded the sociodramatic play of the preschool years as essential for further development of playspecically for movement toward game play in middle childhood In makebelieve the rules of play are implicit preschoolers are hardly aware of enacting them Instead they are caught up in creating imaginary situationsputting a stuffed animal to bed driving an ambulance to a train crash or ringing up a customers purchase at the cash register Winning and losing team membership and competition and purposefully laying down rules are not of great interest to preschoolers Try playing a rulebased game with a or yearold and you are likely to nd that the child is easily sidetracked If with your prompting and guidance the child does nish the game he or she might say I won or Everybody won regardless of the outcomeWith age the imaginativeness of play recedes In the games that captivate schoolage children rules come to the forefront Six to yearolds are often preoccupied with working out the rules of a game and making sure all players follow them They often spend as much or more time on the details of how a game should proceed as they do playing the game itself Nevertheless every organized game with rules contains an imaginary situation in veiled form In Monopoly children are real estate moguls in baseball they emulate HallofFame idols Children retain both aspects of play in changing balances throughout developmentIncreasing emphasis on the ruleoriented side of play extends the zone forged by fantasy play during the preschool years By making children more aware of the goals of their play activities game play further strengthens childrens capacity to overcome impulse Consciously striving to reach a goal requires planningpostponing action in favor of thinking out what to do in advance organizing ones behavior in accord with the plan evaluating how well the plan is working along the way and revising the plan if necessary In the simple games of the late preschool and early school years the play goal is very clearin hideandseek to keep the person who is it from nding you in Chutes and Ladders to travel a road with as many shortcuts and as few setbacks as possible getting to the nish line rst Gradually the goals of childrens games become more distant and complex Attaining those goals requires more intermediate steps and greater knowledge skill and coordination of play actions with those of othersin Tball and kickball scoring more runs than the other team while adhering to fair procedures for batting pitching and elding in chess moving each type of piece according to its special rule in an effort to checkmate the opposing king Through game play children receive additional experience in setting goals in regulating behavior in pursuit of those goals and in subordinating behavior to rules And in negotiating rules in peerorganized games children deepen their understanding of why rules are necessary and which ones work well In the process they form more mature concepts of fairness and justice Indeed parents and teachers often remark that game play prepares children for the inevitability of real downfalls and teaches perseverance and good sportsmanshipIn sum the development of play proceeds from makebelieve with an overt imaginary situation and covert rules to organized games with overt rules and a covert imaginary situation The vast yet nearly effortless learning that takes place through pretending makes it for Vygotsky the highest level of preschool development The child moves forward essentially through play activity Makebelieve play in Vygotskys theory is the preeminent educational activity of early childhoodcontributions of makebelieve play to developmentVygotsky emphasized the developmentenhancing forwardmoving consequences of makebelieve Was he correct that pretending in early childhood has a farreaching impact on development supporting the emergence and renement of a wide variety of competencies Indeed much evidence ts with Vygotskys conclusion Sociodramatic play with peers has been studied most thoroughly Comparisons of preschoolers sociodramatic activities with their social nonpretend pursuits such as drawing pictures or putting puzzles together in the company of agemates supports Vygotskys view of makebelieve as a zone in which children enhance their own development In social pretending preschoolers engage in lengthier interactions are more involved draw more children into their activity and are more cooperative In view of these ndings it is not surprising that and yearolds who spend more time at sociodramatic play are advanced in intellectual development and are judged more socially competent by their teachers Furthermore pretend play fosters a diverse array of specic cognitive and social skills which contribute to these broadbaseed outcomes Lets take some examplesAttentionAttention is fundamental to all human thinking It determines the information considered in any task and whether the task will be completed As any parent or teacher knows young children spend only short times involved in most activities and are easily distracted Yet attention becomes more sustained over early childhooda development that equips children for concentrated involvement which will be essential for success once they enter schoolUnder what conditions are preschoolers most likely to display sustained attention Think back to the examples of Sophies and Matties behavior at the beginning of this chapter and the answer will be clear during play especially complex play In two studies psychologist Holly Ruff and her collaborators sat toddlers and preschoolers at a table of toys Childrens patterns of attention changed dramatically with age After playing for a short time with a toy to yearolds dropped it and turned to another Their attention was externally controlled by the physical properties of the objects Hence they itted from one toy to another and lost interest as the play session progressed But once children began to set goals in play the nature of their attention changed It became effortful as indicated by eyes xed on the toys and a determined facial expression For the youngest children play goals were often as simple as getting a cap off a bottle With age the problems and challenges children set for themselves became more elaborate such as building an intricate structure out of small blocks or acting out a fantasy scenario The more complex childrens play goals the more they displayed focused effortful attention and the more such attention increased over the play session And in one of the studies both construction and imaginative play were powerful predictors of sustained attention between ages and With respect to makebelieve when preschoolers create very intricate scenarios either on their own or with play partners they generally stay absorbed for a very long timeRecall the anecdote about David who remained an attentive pupil considerably longer while playing school than he did in other kindergarten activities Preschoolers sustained attention is more advanced in makebelieve than in many reallife pursuits When permitted to select freely among diverse activities at child care or preschool young children overwhelmingly prefer fantasy play Observing in a childcare center richly equipped with play materials Kathleen Kirby one of my graduate students found that to yearolds spent to percent of freechoice periods immersed in makebelievenearly twice as much time as they devoted to any other activity The rapt attention engendered in pretend play may eventually carry over to nonpretend contextsMemoryFantasy play also strengthens young childrens memories Preschoolers remember information better in a play context than in a context in which information is isolated from its everyday use and they are told to remember deliberately Psychologist Lawrence Newman permitted one group of and yearolds to play with a set of toys and told another group simply to remember the toys Play produced far better recall During the remember condition children repeatedly named and touched the objectsa rehearsal strategy that much like repeating a phone number helped them hold on to information but only briey In contrast the play condition led to many spontaneous organizations of the toys that enabled children to recall effortlessly Often these grew out of makebelievefor example putting the toy shoes on the doll and pretending to feed her the toy banana Narrating imaginative activities also yielded excellent recall as in Im squeezing this lemon or Fly away in this helicopter doggie When children embedded an object in meaningful makebelieve they increased its memorablenessFurthermore children acting out stories during pretend play are assisted in mastering the storytelling script or basic framework of story organization Preschoolers pretend scenarios are often quite storylike consisting of characters settings and plot sequences that include adventure suspense surprise conict and resolution Witness the following trip to Sea World during which Emily and her friends save Baby Shamu from dangerS to Emily Would you come with us Lets go to Sea WorldE Sea World Lets watch Shamu Im the mom All three children run to one end of the room and sit down next to one another They gaze toward the other end of the roomS Oh I see ShamuE Its starting presumably the showA J YeahE Theres a little sh Theres a big momS Theres a daddyE Look He fell on the ice Look at em Mommy and Daddy are fell OhhhhS Patting a pretend Baby Shamu Ohhhh I know youre all right All make stroking motions on a pretend Baby ShamuE Look All better now She pretends to lift Baby Shamu back into the water Children like Emily who have formed a sense of story through makebelieve more readily grasp the organization and meaning of new stories and are therefore more likely to remember them Young pretenders also impose the standards of story organization on the way they recall and explain their experiences to others Their verbal narratives are more cohesive than those of agemates who prefer other forms of play In helping children grasp the storytelling script and in other ways we will take up next makebelieve play is wonderful preparation for literacy Being able to anticipate story organization eases the task of making sense of written prose It also grants children a rm foundation for authoring their rst written narrativesLanguage and LiteracyAs the ndings just mentioned illustrate makebelieve greatly enriches childrens facility with language During sociodramatic activities preschoolers hear speech that describes and comments on actions going on at the moment This helps ensure that language is understandable because it is in tune with ongoing events Consequently when new words arise in the course of a fantasy scene children can determine their meaning easily from cues in the situation In this way vocabulary extends during makebelieve as children introduce words they have heard during recent experiences For example Im going out I need my cloak said yearold Lizzy mimicking an expression she had heard in a TV movie while grabbing a dressup raincoat from a hook in the housekeeping area at child care You mean your coat asked Lizzies playmateRight a cloak is a coat Lizzie explained The amount of time preschoolers spent talking with peers while pretending is positively associated with the size of their vocabularies at age As children engage in play talk they not only build their vocabularies but correct one anothers errors either directly or by demonstrating the acceptable way to speak In one instance a kindergartner enacting a telephone conversation said Hello come to my house please Her play partner quickly countered with appropriate telephone greeting behavior No rst youve got to say How are you What are you doingFurthermore the language skills required to express different points of view resolve disagreements and persuade peers to collaborate so play can continue are complex and often subtle Emilys success in convincing several classmates to join the makebelieve trip to Sea World was partly due to the way she approached themby asking if theyd like to go By experimenting with language during play children can see how others react to various styles of communication and use that information to rene their way of speaking In this way play is an ideal arena for mastering all aspects of conversational dialogueOpportunities to acquire literacyrelevant skills also abound in makebelieve play In one kindergarten children transformed the blockbuilding area into a makebelieve recycling center with the help of their teacher Signs were prepared that advertised the new center its hours and what it would pay for various goods As in other friendly businesses attendants wore nametags such as Hi Im Charles When customers arrived with goods the attendants had to ll out receipts listing each item its quantity and its value Since many children could not yet spell they used rst letters or drew pictures of items While doing so they often became curious about how to write the full word and asked the teacher to help them What does research say about the role of makebelieve in childrens literacy development The amount of time children devote to pretending at age is positively related to reading and writing skills after entering kindergarten and rst gradespecically the extent to which children spontaneously read words on game cards and signs understand print concepts and write letters and simple words The more children engage in literacyrelevant play activities like the recycling center the more advanced their literacy skills are as well Preschoolers commentary about language while pretending using such verbs as say talk tell write and explain is a particularly good predictor of reading progress at age Using language to talk about language happens often as peers jointly create fantasy scenes Such talk may help children treat both oral and written narratives as objects of analysis hence its benets for early reading With respect to writing object substitutions and role play seem to have special benets Frequently using objects to symbolize other objects and transforming oneself into various characters may encourage children to try to make sense of other symbol systems such as how to express themselves with print In their rst efforts to write preschoolers commonly assume that letters just like pictures and rst substitute objects look like their meanings In one instance a child stated with certainty that the word deer begins with the letter O because O is shaped like a deer then he demonstrated by drawing an O and adding antlers to it Flexibly using makebelieve symbols seems to assist children in revising early incorrect ideas about how print is used to communicateHypothetical ReasoningDuring the preschool and elementary school years thought is largely tied to the hereandnow Children think in an organized fashion about concrete information they can directly perceive but have great difficulty reasoning about hypothetical situationsones that do not make sense in the real world For example try giving a child between and the following problem Suppose dogs are bigger than elephants and elephants are bigger than mice Which one is the biggest dogs elephants or mice Most will insist that dogs couldnt possibly be bigger than elephants Thats never true they exclaimYet with the help of makebelieve even preschoolers can transcend these limits and reason about situations that defy realworld knowledge Consider the following impossible premises and question All cats bark Rex is a cat Does Rex bark Psychologists Maria Dias and Paul Harris had one group of to yearolds act out problems like this one using toys that represented the content of the premises A second group was told that the events were taking place on a pretend planet rather than on Earth And a third group merely listened and answered the questions Children in the two play conditions gave more hypothetical responses and also justied their answers with hypothetical ideasfor example by saying In the story cats bark so we can pretend they barkThe capacity to adopt a theoretical mode of reasoning in makebelieve is highly consistent with Vygotskys belief that pretending assists children in separating mental symbols from the objects and actions for which they stand thereby permitting them to manipulate meanings in innovative ways Reasoning about the nonreal is essential for abstract thinking and for many creative endeavorsthat is for human cognition to reach its highest potentialDistinguishing Appearance from RealityAfter kissing their preschooler goodnight and turning out the lights many parents are accustomed to hearing refrains like this Mommy Daddy monsters are in my room again To rid the bedroom of scary creatures pictures and mobiles may have to be removed and a thorough search conducted to assure the child that no monsters are lurking in the shadows waiting to reappear as soon as the parent leaves Uncertainty about the relation between appearance and reality also surfaces in other situations On Halloween a yearold who eagerly dons her costume may become frightened at the sight of her animal or witchlike appearance in the mirror And a father who shaves off his beard and mustache may nd that his young preschooler reacts with puzzlement and distress to his changed appearanceConsistent with these alltoofamiliar experiences research conrms that preschoolers are easily tricked by the outward appearance of things They mistakenly conclude that the way things look or sound is the way they really are In several studies psychologists John Flavell Francis Green and Eleanor Flavell presented children with appearancereality problems in which objects were disguised in various ways The children were asked what the objects were really and truly Before age or most children took things at face value When asked whether a white piece of paper placed behind a blue lter is really and truly blue or whether a can that sounds like a baby crying when turned over is really and truly a baby they responded Yes Yet in makebelieve children use objects to symbolize things that are very different from the objects themselvesa ball to stand for an apple a laundry basket for a cradle They do not judge these imaginary symbols to be real so clearly they can tell the difference between pretend and real experiences long before they can answer many appearancereality problems correctly The more to yearolds spontaneously engage in joint makebelieve with classmates at preschool the better they can distinguish the apparent and real identities of disguised objects Pretending with peers may help children master appearance reality distinctions because it offers repeated practice in transforming a wide variety of objects from their real state to a pretend state and back againUnderstanding the Mind and Its Many ActivitiesMakebelieve play provides a rich foundation for childrens comprehension of the minds wideranging capabilities In Chapter I noted that childrens elaborate interactions with imaginary companions foster understanding of false belief and other peoples perspectives In sociodramatic play as well opportunities to act out and coordinate various roles probably help children grasp similarities and differences between people in desires beliefs and feelings Recently a mother recounted to me a makebelieve episode initiated by her yearold daughter Traci involving extended experimentation with and reversals of roles which led to abundant dialogue about mental states One evening Traci her two older sisters and her parents had gathered in the living room to watch a video of The Sound of Music Although Traci showed little interest in the movie her ears perked up at a statement in the sound track reporting the death of the mother of the Trappfamily children Traci began to ask questions to talk about how the mother must have gotten sick and gone to the hospital and to repeat that the mother had died For the next hour and a half she assigned her own mother and herself at least fteen different rolesmother father baby sister doctor nurse and moreas she explored the idea of a mother dying Traci Here youre the baby and Im the mama Honey Im going to the hospitalMother Go to the hospital and have the doctor help you feel betterTraci No Im not going to feel better Im going to dieMother frantically No no I dont want you to die Ill be very very sadTraci OK dont worry itll be all rightSome scenarios like this one ended happily others were lled with depressing events and ended sadly In acting them out Traci imagined and simulated diverse wants hopes worries and strivings of people in her life As this brief vignette illustrates sociodramatic play is rich in mentalstate language especially references to emotion As children learn about mental states from conversing and engaging in makebelieve with adults they transfer this knowledge to sociodramatic play with peers The more and yearold friends talk about mental states during joint makebelieve the better they perform and the more they improve over the following year on tasks assessing their grasp of mental life These include understanding of false belief identifying the feelings of a puppet acting out emotionally charged situations such as seeing a parent off on a trip and explaining reallife causes of happiness sadness anger fear and mixed emotions for example why one might feel both happy and sad about winning a race against a friend Talk between siblings that focuses on feelings seems to play a particularly strong role in the diversity of themes that siblings act out in their joint makebelieve Complexity of play with siblings in turn is a good indicator of preschoolers understanding of other peoples feelingsmore so than is their play with mothers Why might conversing and pretending with siblings make a special contribution to childrens capacity to read others emotions In interacting with their child mothers spend much time acknowledging and clarifying the childs feelings Siblings as well as preschool friends frequently articulate how they themselves feel Therefore siblings more often expose the child to the inner states of someone other than the child himself or herself The more affectionate and cooperative siblings relationships are the more sophisticated their sociodramatic play Siblings who get along well are probably better at creating and sustaining elaborate makebelieve scenariosplay that contributes to their emotional sensitivity As children build on each others play themes they often refer to their makebelieve with mental terms by making statements like these Lets pretend Lets imagine You act like a pilot and Ill makebelieve Im in the control tower Some experts believe that this suspension of play to communicate about it marks a major change in understanding Now children do not just represent experiences in play they display awareness that makebelieve is an activity in which the mind creates events As a result children become capable of consciously reecting on and deliberately manipulating their own and others fanciful representations and their play becomes even more complex and imaginativeResearchers continue to debate whether preschoolers actually view pretending as a mental state rather than just a series of actions mirroring real life But there is clear evidence that their grasp of makebelieve as a mental activity improves steadily between ages and Over time they can answer more subtle questions about the nature of makebelieve For example by age most realize that pretending depends on having prior knowledge about a makebelieve role That is a person hopping can be pretending to be a rabbit only if he or she knows that rabbits hop Children age and older also recognize that makebelieve is something you can do just inside your head without using your body at allWhy is this understanding of makebelieve as mental representation so important When children master this and other related ideasthat people are constantly engaged in thought even when they have nothing to do that mental inferences not just direct observations can lead to new knowledge and that prior experiences affect peoples interpretations of new experiencesthey show that they have begun to pay more attention to the processes of thought Thinking about thought makes possible a major advance in selfregulation It permits children to call on what they know about mental life to surmount cognitive and social challenges The child well aware of the minds active transforming capabilities is more likely to attend to relevant information to plan to use memory and problemsolving strategies and to evaluate and revise his or her thinking to make it more effective In sum makebelieve in early childhood is among those factors that promote reective thought which improves throughout the school yearsSelfRegulationAs we have just seen pretend play through its impact on childrens awareness of the mind fosters advanced forms of selfregulation But what about the selfregulatory capacities that emerge earlier during the preschool yearsselfguiding private speech willingness to take on chores and capacity to delay gratication for brief periods Does makebelieve foster these early indicators of a selfregulated child Findings of several studies I carried out with my graduate students suggest that it doesprivate speechIn the rst of these studies we reasoned that if Vygotsky is correct that children learn to overcome impulse and manage their behavior through pretend play then private speech should be especially frequent within makebelieve activities To nd out graduate student Kerry Krafft and I observed to yearolds during freechoice periods in two contexts differing sharply in encouragement of imaginative play the Y Preschool called this because it is sponsored by the YWCA and the Montessori Preschool In the Y Preschool play formed the basis of the daily program Children had easy access to a wide variety of toys games and books and each classroom contained two centers especially conducive to sociodramatic play a blockbuilding area with hundreds of blocks varying in size and shape and a childsized playhouse brimming with all manner of housekeeping props The Montessori Preschool in contrast actively discouraged makebelieve although not all Montessori schools do so Spurred by philosophical principles advocating realistic activities the Montessori teachers set up work stations from which children selected Typical options were puzzles picturematching and picturesequencing tasks letter tracing small construction blocks containers with water for pouring books and crayons and other tools for drawing and writing When Montessori children strayed into makebelieve teachers often interrupted drawing them back to workstation pursuits Nevertheless Montessori children did engage in pretending but it was sharply restricted relative to children in the Y Preschool who displayed three times as much imaginative play What happened to private speech It showed a parallel trend Children in the Y Preschool engaged in twice as much selftalk as did children in the Montessori preschool Furthermore pretend play emerged as the strongest correlate of both fantasyplay private speech and selfguiding private speech That is the more children engaged in makebelieve the more they talked to themselves to work out pretend characters actions and to guide their thought and behavior during realistic tasks This latter nding suggests that private speech so rich in the makebelieve context may carry over to childrens selftalk when they face realworld challengesRecall from Chapter that as children master puzzles and other problemsolving tasks their selfguiding speech declines Yet when graduate student Tina Gillingham and I observed preschoolers in a laboratory playroom liberally equipped with fantasyplay props we found that private speech during makebelieve remained uniformly high from ages to and actually increased at age Our interpretation of the prevalence of private speech during makebelieve is that children continually set challenges for themselves in fantasy play Consistent with Vygotskys theory they create their own zones frequently calling on selfdirected language to work out their imaginings and bring behavior under the control of thoughtsocially responsible behaviorIn yet another study graduate student Cynthia Elias and I addressed the question of whether complex makebelieve specically sociodramatic play involving elaborate communication between agematespromotes socially responsible behavior During the fall of the school year we observed and yearolds as they played in the block and housekeeping centers of their preschools and rated the quantity and maturity of their fantasy endeavors Then we assessed social responsibility by observing the children during cleanup periods recording the extent to which they willingly picked up and put away toys without prompting and assistance We made these cleanup observations in the fall and again in the spring so we could measure gain in responsible behavior Our ndings revealed that preschoolers who more often engaged in complex sociodramatic play showed greater improvement in social responsibility over the next to months And this relationship was particularly strong for children rated by their parents as highly impulsivethat is who were poorly selfregulated to begin with In other words children most in need of enhancing their selfregulatory abilities appeared especially sensitive to the benets of sociodramatic playImagination and CreativityIn addition to its contribution to many nonplay skills makebelieve can be examined on its own terms as an imaginative activity that expresses salient aspects of the childs inner cognitive and emotional life In Vygotskys theory the drive to fantasize and engage in role play does not fade away with childhood Instead he maintained the imagination of later years is an internalized condensed form of early childhood makebelieve that can be considered play without action We typically experience it as an elaborate stream of consciousness made up of mental images and silent selftalk that meanders along remarking on new experiences reecting on the past and predicting the futureBy introducing fantasy elements into consciousness this inventive private commentary probably helps us cope with the mundane repetitive aspects of our daily lives We resort to such ruminations while waiting during long car trips or meetings and at other monotonous or idle times In this way early makebelieve forties us with a mental tool that is vital for adapting to everyday life And from time to time we apply logical adaptive thinking to this inner playfulness to harness it for culturally worthwhile purposes The result may be a creative idea or productWas Vygotsky correct that the imaginative mental combinations that form the basis for creativity originate in the pretend scenarios of early childhood Unfortunately we have no longterm studies that systematically observed children for the imaginativeness of their play and then tracked them to document their creative accomplishments in adulthood And even if such studies were available many intervening events could blur the connection between early play and adult creativity At present all we have available to explore this relationship are the recollections of highly creative individuals about their childhoods or the reports of their biographersOn a recent visit to my local library I browsed the shelves devoted to biography selecting several dozen life stories of accomplished writers artists and scientists The accounts were remarkably consistent For most pretend play was an inuential aspect of their early years Often a signicant persona parent an older sibling or a relativepromoted imaginative experimentation and a sense of wonder by telling fantastic stories initiating joint pretend or offering gifts such as books and puppets that inspired makebelieve For example biographical accounts of physicist Marie Curie codiscoverer of radium and twice winner of the Nobel Prize invariably make reference to her fathers untiring efforts to provide his children with ideas and games to ll their spare time A chest of colored blocks had special meaning Marie and her older siblings used the blocks to represent cities mountains rivers countries and continents Their father a high school science teacher often joined in capitalizing on play as a way to teach geography In the home in which Marie Curie grew up one biographer summed up play was learning and learning was playIn poet Sylvia Plaths childhood stories and storytelling were pervasive As a yearold Sylvia was intensely jealous of her sickly younger brother for consuming so much of her mothers attention While the baby nursed Sylvia sat nearby on the oor impatient and unhappy Her mother discovered that she could defuse Sylvias envy with a game in which Sylvia spread out the newspaper before her picked out all the capital letters on the page and pretended in a very grownup way to readan achievement that attracted much parental admiration Sylvias mother often made up bedtime tales serialized from one evening to the next Almost as soon as they could talk Sylvia and her brother responded in kind with limericks poems and fantastic stories of their own On walks to their grandparents house and on long car trips favorite books invariably came along offering ready inspiration for the childrens imaginative creations Filmstar Charlie Chaplins mother was herself a talented comedy actress and singer As a young child Charlie often accompanied her when she went to work at the theater As a result playacting and impersonating became an early focus of Charlies pretending One evening during a performance his mothers voice failed In a pinch the stage manager who had seen Charlie at play led the little boy onstage in her place Charlie continued his playacting unabated which included songs dances and impersonations from his mothers repertoire He was demonstrating the wares of his rst and best teacher in the art of makebelieve and the performance evoked a roar of appreciation and a shower of coins from the crowdIn these and many other similar biographical anecdotes childhood makebelieve engendered imaginativeness that was clearly related to outstanding accomplishment in adulthood Of course the scientic and artistic talents of individuals like Curie Plath and Chaplin are rare among us Nevertheless as play theorists Dorothy and Jerome Singer point out all children have that same potential for playfulness for trying out possible lives that is the foundation for a humbler but personally meaningful creativityadult involvement in childrens makebelievePiagets view of makebelieve play dominant until recently asserts that pretending emerges spontaneously when children become capable of symbolic thought He assumed that very young children could not share play symbols with others Yet in instance after instance we have seen that adults are central in preschoolers play lives often encouraging and elaborating on their imaginative strivings If adults are prominent in early makebelieve how did researchers manage to adhere to an image of young children as solitary fantasizers for so long The reason is that until recently makebelieve was largely studied in the laboratory in sessions in which children arrived oneatatime and had no alternative but to play by themselves Only during the past years have researchers seriously addressed the social context of makebelieve Their ndings conrm that pretending like other higher forms of thinking ows from social collaboration More competent partners scaffold young childrens imaginative play guiding its emergence and gradual renement Once pretend capacities are in place children forge playful understandings with peers that serve as microcosms of cooperative activity mirroring social relations and goaloriented pursuits within the larger societyScaffolding Childrens PlayTraci the yearold who responded so strongly to the mothers death in The Sound of Music often pretends with her own mother Julie For some weeks Traci had been talking about a mysterious creature she called a maserus Tracis description of the creature convinced Julie that the maserus was an imaginative friendly monster Congested due to spring allergies Traci was particularly irritable one morning Well aware that Traci loves makebelieve activities her mother tried to distract her with a favorite pastime As Traci sneezed and whimpered Julie spied a halffull white garbage bag in a corner situated in such a way that it looked like an animal with a snout I think I see a maserus Julie declared pointing to the garbage bag Immediately Traci cast off her irritability and jumped into action Over the next hour she and her mother fed the maserus more trash read books and sang songs to it and laughed at the monsters antics By the end of our delightful session Julie remarked I almost felt the bag was alive When the activity changed to the more practical concerns of the day Tracis problematic irritability resumedRecent research reveals that makebelieve is from the outset a social activity In Western societies it usually rst appears between parents and children although older siblings may participate as well From these interactions children derive many play skills that enhance their makebelieve in other contexts In one of the most extensive studies tracing the development of makebelieve play psychologists Wendy Haight and Peggy Miller followed nine children from to years of age repeatedly visiting their homes to make intensive observations of their pretending The researchers found that most makebelievefrom to percentwas social across the entire age span Mothers were the childrens principal play partners from ages to Over time motherchild play declined and childchild play increased By age children played about equally with their mothers and with other childrenboth siblings and peers The dominance of motherchild pretend at the youngest ages however was not due to lack of child playmates Up to age even if siblings and peers were present children preferred playing with their mothers Furthermore Haight and Miller as well as other researchers report clear evidence that mothers teach their toddlers to pretend At age mothers initiate almost all makebelieve episodes They also demonstrate many pretend actions toward objects thereby showing children how to use one object to represent another Around age mothers begin to talk about nonexistent fantasy objects In one instance a mother suggested that an empty bowl was full of juicy oranges one for each of her sons miniature zoo animals This change may help children increase the range and complexity of their play symbolsSocial Functions and Consequences of AdultChild PlayJoint adultchild makebelieve serves a wide variety of social purposes Here is a sampling Teaching At times caregivers use pretending as a pleasurable way to teach children realworld skills For example Michaels mother capitalized on makebelieve to encourage her yearold to use the toilet Reluctant at rst Michael became an eager learner after being put in charge of toilet training his teddy bear Enlivening daily routines Often children and their caregivers call on pretend play to relieve the monotony of chores and other repetitive tasks While yearold Molly folded socks with her mother she put a pair together held it up and exclaimed Mommy I made us something to eatDefusing conflict Occasionally makebelieve can defuse persistent caregiverchild conicts Concerned about yearold Nancys use of a pacier her mother had been trying to get her to give it up Nancy resisted As they played with puppets Nancy announced I want a pacier Her mothers puppet responded Little girl You have only a red dot for a mouth I dont think you can t a pacier in thereExpressing and regulating emotion Tracis exploration with her mothers help of what it might be like to have a mother who got sick and died exemplies how parents and children use makebelieve to express and manage intense feelings In pretend scenarios Traci acted out feeling ill feeling better sadness happiness worry love and caringInuencing anothers social behavior Joint makebelieve can be an effective strategy for attaining a social goal When yearold Molly stood at the top of a slide and asked for help her mother tried to get her to slide down on her own Molly refused and stepped into pretend A shark Theres a shark in the sand Mollys mother immediately helped her downHaving fun As illustrations of adultchild makebelieve throughout this chapter affirm most of the time parents and children engage in imaginative play just for fun In fact some theorists have argued that the earliest expressions of humor emerge out of fantasy play Consistent with this claim participating in adultchild makebelieve seems to precede childrens rst verbal jokes One toddler named Ari having become an avid makebeliever soon showed a corresponding rise in joking At months he touched a picture of a sheep in a book his mother was reading to him exclaimed Neigh and laughed hysterically At months while watching his mother wash dishes he remarked Nutmeg the family cat drinks water with spoon and then interpreted Funny thing Ari tell Mommy joke As Aris humor makes plain pretending is not just a pleasurable activity in itself but brings pleasure to life in generalThat joint makebelieve with adults is such great fun is undoubtedly a major reason that to yearolds are so attracted to it But why is play with adults at least initially more engaging than play with peers While childrens play skills are still limited adult scaffolding makes play more interesting surprising and absorbing In several studies to yearolds engaged in more than twice as much makebelieve when their mothers were involved than when they were not In addition caregiver support led early makebelieve to move toward a more advanced level For example when mothers actively took part children produced more complex pretend sequencesnot just putting the doll to sleep but brushing her teeth tucking her into bed singing a lullaby and kissing her good night Furthermore during parentchild play makebelieve themes are more varied and parents verbal commentary is especially effective in raising both the duration and the complexity of play In line with the zone children for whom makebelieve is just emerging act more competently when playing with an adult partner than they otherwise would In Haight and Millers investigation yearolds whose mothers engaged in a great deal of pretending ranked especially high in peer play at age And children of the most imaginative and enthusiastic parents were among the most highly skilled preschool pretendersVital Features of AdultChild PlayHow should parents caregivers and teachers go about engaging young children in makebelieve Effective scaffolding of play is somewhat different from scaffolding of nonplay tasks In fostering play adults might have explicit goals such as teaching culturally valued knowledge and skills and promoting selfregulation and imagination But directiveness and didactic teaching are seldom if ever necessary As play theorist Brian SuttonSmith pointed out more than a quartercentury ago makebelieve enables children who are still acquiring language to represent their everyday lives and inner thoughts and feelings more completely than is possible through any other symbolic means This conrms Vygotskys statement that in play the child always behaves beyond his average age above his daily behavior Look back at the vignettes described in this chapterof Sophie giving a sleepy teddy bear a pacier of Alison recalling the train crash in India of Emily traveling to Sea World and of Traci roleplaying a mother getting sick and dyingand note how difficult it would be for to yearolds to construct such wellarticulated ideas only in words or in their drawings Consequently adults do not need to tutor preschoolers in pretending as they sometimes do when helping them master puzzles or other similar tasksInstead adult participation in makebelieve works best when it responds to guides and builds on the childs behaviors with demonstrations and suggestions In support of this approach psychologist Barbara Fieses observations of mothers playing with their to montholds revealed that maternal questions directions and intrusions initiating a new activity unrelated to the childs current play led to immature behavior in which toddlers merely mouthed touched and looked at toys Relentlessly barraging children with information that communicates at rather than with them fails to involve them in dialogue and interferes with optimum development of play In contrast turntaking and joint involvement in which mothers sustained or expanded on their childs play themes evoked high levels of pretending Maternal interactions that suggest play options related to yearolds ongoing activityfor example saying Oh is the doll trying to swim as the child puts a doll into a toy cupcontinue to predict extended makebelieve sequences and imaginative object substitutions at age In contrast toddlers whose mothers negate and correctNo dolls dont go in cups they go in the doll housetend to become yearolds who spend much time in simple immature manipulation of toys Finally the shared understanding underlying any type of adultchild communication that creates the zone is also essential in makebelieve Sensitive and mutually rewarding interaction between mother and baby in the rst year of life predicts complexity of motherchild pretending and childrens use of mentalstate words during play at age Parental behaviors that assist infants in connecting socially and becoming effective conversationalists seem to enhance their play competence and ability to talk about others thoughts and feelings later on In sum quality of adultchild social engagement both within and outside of makebelieve play has much to do with the potential of such play to lead childrens development forwardenhancing sociodramatic play with peersAt child care yearold Sammy joins a group of children in the block area for a space shuttle launch That can be our control tower he suggests to Vance pointing to a corner by a bookshelfWait I gotta get it ready calls out Lynette who is still arranging the astronauts two dolls and a bear inside a circle of large blocks which represents the rocket OK all aboard Discovery Sammy broadcasts into a small wooden block his pretend loudspeaker After Lynette sets up the astronauts Sammy announces Countdown Five six two four one blastoff responds Vance commander of the control tower Lynette makes one of the dolls push a pretend button and reports Brrrm brrrm theyre going upAmong children who have regular contact with peers sociodramatic play with agemates increases greatly between ages and As this excerpt reveals by age children can create and coordinate several characters in an elaborate plot and weave together intricate role relationships and story linesfactors that as we have seen contribute greatly to their cognitive and social competencePretending with peers draws on the diverse communication skills children develop with adults A secure infantparent attachment bond which grows out of caregiver warmth responsiveness and sensitive communication predicts socially mature peer play in early childhood including cooperation empathy and popularity And as I indicated in Chapter the blend of warmth and expectations for mature behavior that make up authoritative parenting is linked to skilled peer interaction as well Social play with agemates must be responsive and harmonious to result in pleasurable satisfying longlasting play If sociodramatic play with agemates is to serve as a zone for learning shared understanding or intersubjectivity is essential just as it is in adult child dialogues In the shuttlelaunch episode Sammy Vance and Lynette reached a high level of intersubjectivity as they worked out a division of labor and responded to one another in a smooth complementary fashion Of course children do argue and disagree Piaget underscored the role of these conicts in getting children to give up their egocentrism and notice others perspectives Yet conict is far less effective in promoting sensitivity to others beliefs thoughts and feelings than is returning to a state of intersubjectivityby engaging in cooperative dialogues and resolving differences of opinionIntersubjectivity among preschool play partners increases with age When psychologist Artin Gnc observed and yearolds engaged in sociodramatic pursuits the yearolds more often considered their partners preferences and built on their partners play actsby asking a partner what he or she would like to do introducing relevant new elements into the play narrative compromising in instances of conict and expressing agreement with the partners ideas These features of play reect childrens developing sensitivity to diverse points of view and their appreciation of the value of a meeting of minds for pleasurable rewarding playResearch indicates that parents and teachers rarely mediate preschoolers peer relations unless intense disagreements arise that threaten safety or in the case of teachers classroom order And when adults do step in they seldom use interventions that help children regulate their own interaction Instead adults often resort to directive strategies in which they tell children exactly what to say and do and therefore solve the problem for them as in Dont grab Ask for a turn or Wait until Sandra is nishedThese techniques are appropriate for children who lack social skills and therefore at least initially benet from clear direction But adults need to modify these strategies to suit childrens play maturity providing assistance tailored to the childs zone Sticking with directive interventions does not prompt children to come up with effective solutions to conict as it arisesstrategies that work because they take into account both the childs and the playmates desiresAt times the adult might model a social skill or give the child examples of strategies as in You could ask Paul Would you let me try it for a while or you could say May we share it At other times the adult might encourage the child to generate possible strategies What could you do to get Mary and Andrea to let you play too In each instance parents and teachers select the level of support that best matches the childs current social capacities and then pull back as the child acquires new social problemsolving skills Many parents and teachers hesitate to mediate childrens play perhaps because they believe incorrectly that children pick up social skills just by spending time with agemates Vygotskys theory tells us that adults are active agents in childrens social development If they wait until a childs negative acts become extreme then their rst impulse is to assert high control and sometimes force The following three suggestions can help parents and teachers select strategies that foster more mature social behaviorIntervene soon enough to prevent peer difficulties from escalating thereby avoiding highly intrusive intervention tacticsFocus on developing the skills of each child not just on quelling disturbances Ask yourself What have I seen this child do in situations similar to this one How can I help the child communicate more effectivelyThink in terms of the support that is necessary without taking over social responsibilities that children can assume on their own Ask yourself How much of my help does the child require to meet his or her goals in this situation A general prompt Some suggested strategies Or a specic directive and a demonstrationCompared to sociodramatic play preschoolers nd it harder to establish a cooperative shared framework when working together on realistic projects such as construction puzzle and art activities To collaborate on these tasks they need much more adult instruction and monitoring than they do in makebelieve activities Here again childrens social competence is more advanced in makebelieve play than in other situations The social skills mastered in sociodramatic activities gradually generalize helping children work toward shared goals in nonplay pursuitsphysical contexts for makebelieve playAdults promote childrens makebelieve not just through scaffolding their pretending and social behavior but also through arranging a stimulating appropriate play environment The physical context of childrens play is important because it shapes play themes and opportunities to interact with agemates Consequently it can have a profound impact on what children learnPlay MaterialsToys and other play props should capitalize on childrens current makebelieve capacities while gently spurring children forward toward a wider range of themes roles and characters and increasingly intricate story lines As children become conscious of the goals of play and more concerned with rules and rulefollowing adults can provide opportunities for game play Then they can extend these understandings by gradually introducing more complex gamesMartha Bronsons The Right Stuff for Children Birth to Age is an excellent resource for selecting play materials that support development in early childhood Although it is written for teachers preschool and childcare center directors and elementary school principals it can also guide parents Here is an overview of changing needs for makebelieve and game materials from toddlerhood into the primary gradesbeginnings months to yearsToddlers need a small selection of realisticlooking toys to support their beginning capacity to pretend These include stuffed animals soft clothbodied or rubber dolls with simple care accessories a play telephone and housekeeping items to support role play large hand puppets for an adult and small hand puppets for the child and transportation toys both the large riding type and the smaller handmanipulated variety Already picture books can inspire makebelieve especially when they depict familiar objects and experiences By the end of this period as toddlers begin to develop the representational capacities and ne motor skills for setting up scenes themselves they enjoy small peg people that t in cars boats and other vehicles Soon after they are ready for more complex scenesdollhouse garage or barn And some start to dress up an activity that can be supported by old clothing of family membersexpanding makebelieve skills to yearsBetween ages and fantasytheme repertoires expand greatly Children take increasing responsibility for initiating and elaborating makebelieve scenarios rst with adults and older siblings then with agemates During this period they can make use of a wider array of makebelieve materialsdiverse dolls from babies to children their own age and with physical and cultural differences they see in their communities more feeding and care accessories vehicles of different types and sizes play scenes with a larger number of peg people animals and inanimate props large and small blocks for putting together pretend structures and a more varied array of dressup clothingAround this age placing pretend materials in sand and waterplay areas begins to inspire highly imaginative and extended play Also books videos and TV programs with simple narratives offer models that young preschoolers can act out and embellish in makebelieve With respect to TVs potential for inspiring play programs with slowpaced nonviolent action and easytofollow story lines such as Barney and Friends and Mr Rogers Neighborhood lead to more elaborate makebelieve play than do those presenting quick disconnected bits of informationblossoming of sociodramatic play to yearsThe mid to latepreschool years are a time of burgeoning capacity for sociodramatic play especially group pretend Children incorporate more detail into their play themes and benet from increasingly varied and exible propshand and nger puppets dolls with articulated limbs that can be manipulated doll clothing with buttons zippers and other fasteners more housekeeping accessories such as high chairs bassinets and cooking serving and washing equipment and diverse play animals including sh reptiles dinosaurs and exotic speciesOlder preschoolers can comprehend and recall more complex stories and they like books and videos about children their own age animals and everyday life such as a visit to a hospital a re station or a factory They also like ridiculous funny and dramatic fantastic tales Often they memorize those they like best and act them out in makebelieveThe years from to are a time of peak interest in play scenes such as house school airport farm and zoo In addition to prepackaged scene sets children can be provided the raw materialsshoe boxes pipe cleaners cardboard cylinders aluminum foil and art suppliesto create their own scenes Whereas realistic toys encourage preschoolers to act out everyday roles nonspecic materials often encourage fantastic role play such as pirates or creatures from outer space Fantastic roles in turn prompt more complex peer interaction especially statements that plan and comment on the makebelieve scenario itself as in Ill be the pirate and you be the prisoner Since fantastic makebelieve does not follow highly familiar scripts children must devote more energy to working out each episode and explaining what they are doing to their companionsLiteracy objects offer another powerful illustration of how play materials mold makebelieve content Early childhood educators Susan Neuman and Kathy Roskos provided to yearolds in a childcare program with literacyenriched housekeeping office and library areas For example the housekeeping area included cookbooks coupons recipe cards grocery packages and pencils and notepads for listmaking Compared to agemates in a control program without extra literacy props the children engaged in far more complex and extended literacyrelated pretending They more often talked about literacy objects pretended to read and write as part of role play and transformed literacy props imaginatively such as calling a cookbook a magic genie book and a piece of paper directions for ballet lessonsChildren at the upper end of this age range start to become interested in games At rst simple games that depend on chance rather than strategy or skill are bestlotto dominoes and card games based on matching and visual memory such as Concentrationadvanced sociodramatic and game play to yearsIn the early school grades children display an even greater capacity to create replicas of the world around themskills that teachers may build on in extended projects such as studying a Native American village or the wildlife of a rain forest Six to yearolds continue to like role play and teachers can use it to foster their academic development One thirdgrade teacher invented a magic carpet on which her class traveled to different countries integrating all academic areas into the experiencereading writing math science and social studiesAround ages and as children become more conscious of the rules of play they like to act out scripted puppet shows and plays As informal makebelieve declines game play strengthens By the end of this period children formulate and implement strategies and cooperate more effectively in games They have also become interested in competition Hence they are ready for basic strategy gamescheckers chess fantasy and adventure games word games and team sports such as Tball and soccerEquipping and Arranging the Play EnvironmentIn addition to the appropriateness of play materials their quantity and arrangement affect the maturity and diversity of themes in childrens makebelieve These features of the environment also inuence the congeniality of peer interaction With respect to quantity childrens behavior can tell us whether they have too many or too few toys An excess of toys overwhelms and overstimulates The child whose bedroom is piled high with all the latest playthings is likely to cherish and play with few of them Alternatively poorquality childcare centers widespread in the United States are often underequipped with play materials In one such program that I visited the blockbuilding area had only twenty blocks for sixty to yearolds Although a stove table refrigerator and crib lined the perimeter of the housekeeping area there were just three dolls a handful of dishes one pan and six dressup garments to inspire role play Without adults and play props to engage them many younger children wandered aimlessly And rather than becoming immersed in sociodramatic pursuits older children quarreled over the few toys available Research conrms that when playthings are in short supply preschoolers conicts increaseThe power of play spaces to affect the variety of makebelieve themes is dramatically evident in preschoolers genderstereotyped toy choices and pretend themes By age gender differences in play are evident and they strengthen over early childhood Parents vary greatly in their genderrole attitudes the more traditional their beliefs the more genderstereotyped their toy purchases and the more stereotyped their childrens play In many classrooms the arrangement of play areas reinforces these sharp gender distinctions Separate housekeeping and blockbuilding areashubs of preschool pretendingresult in girls gathering in housekeeping where they enact domestic roles and boys congregating in blocks where they build intricate structures play energetically with vehicles and create fantastic and adventurous scenariosWhen graduate student Cheryl Kinsman and I collaborated with a kindergarten teacher to rearrange these play spaces striking changes in childrens play occurred We removed the wall of shelves dividing housekeeping from blocks joining the two areas into one While the shelves were in place play was highly gender stereotyped Children largely interacted with peers of their own gender especially when girls were in housekeeping and boys in blocks Also when boys did enter housekeeping their play was generally irrelevant to the goals of the setting In one instance several boys scurried on all fours around the kitchen table each pushing a large wooden truck while a traffic director stood on a chair shouting Green light go Red light stop But once the play areas were joined boys and girls frequently played together And girls especially engaged in more complex play integrating materials from both areas into their fantasy themes Finally negative interactions between children declined after we removed the divider perhaps because the more open play space reduced crowding and competition for materials As these outcomes illustrate play spaces often promote attitudes and practices of the surrounding culturein ways not evident to teachers and parents Our intervention encouraged this teacher to think more carefully about the impact her classroom design had on the quality of childrens play experiencesthe transformation of the childs play worldThe makebelieve play and games of early childhood offer an inuential route to acquiring cultural values and the selfregulation children need to act in accord with those values In the heat of the childs relentless requests for new toys advertised on TV and in the possession of playmates parents seldom stop to ask the question What activities will this toy inspire What values will the activities teach What social rules will my child learn to follow A comparison of the fantasy activities of American children with those of children in other cultures spotlights potent lessons of the play world not given sufficient conscious consideration Childrens makebelieve places greater emphasis on imaginativeness and autonomy in Western individualistic nations than in collectivist societies While American preschoolers often conjure up fantastic roles and vie with peers for the most stimulating and inuential of them children in Asian cultures devote more hours to play in which they perform actions in unison For example in a game called Bhatto Bhatto East Indian children act out a trip to market requiring intricate touching of one anothers elbows and hands as they pretend to cut and share a tasty vegetable On Childrens Day in the Peoples Republic of China preschoolers gather on lawns outside their classrooms to perform largegroup highly scripted activities for their families They sing stories conveying social and moral lessons while dramatizing them with complex hand motions and body postures in which each child acts identically The personal expressiveness and role negotiation in Western childrens play are well suited for developing innovativeness selfreliance and social problemsolving skillstraits important for success in Western school and work worlds Nevertheless Western childrens play has been transformed into an everenlarging culture of conspicuous consumption encompassing a seemingly endless array of costly fancy amusements Parents are quick to feel guilty about depriving children of the latest educational playthings or jeopardizing their integration into a peer network in which toys and other possessions are a salient basis for belonging Yet parents gatekeeper role with respect to play is as crucial as it is in the realm of TV An important point to note is that many contemporary toys undermine imagination and selfregulation Aggressive toys are the most worrisome Preschoolers who transform a stick or block into a weapon are doing little more than exploring a pervasive aspect of their culture But equipping children with realisticlooking guns swords shields and other tools of warfare is tantamount to setting up a training ground in aggression Such toys foster both pretend and real hostility among peers Boys penchant for high activity excitement and risk taking and their view of weaponry as the ultimate in masculinity attract them to war toys Furthermore when boys play with action gures modeled on violent TV and movie characters such as Power Rangers Transformers and XMen their play narrows to mimicking the characters televised behavior and is generally aggressive and stereotyped Video games with violent plots in which children advance by shooting and evading the enemy are yet another fantasy pursuit that largely appeals to boys A growing number of studies conrm that heavy playing of such games duplicates the effects of violent TV by promoting aggression and desensitizing children to violence Furthermore video games even more than TV are riddled with ethnic and gender stereotypes In watching what happens once fastaction video games have entered their households many parents express another concernthat their children will become addicted to these violent amusements About percent usually boys develop into passionate or excessive players during the elementary school years and desperately need parental intervention Compared to infrequent users children highly involved in video games spend less time productively more often watching cartoons and less often reading One parent whose son Joey spent his early childhood focused on play with Transformers and his school years immersed in video games complained about the boys mediocre grades and lamented Nothing seems to interest him Joey spent so much time with highly stimulating video games that he came to regard slowerpaced pursuits that require greater initiative to reach a goal as dullOf course preschoolerseven those as young as age benet from experience with computers as long as activities are constructive adults are available to support them and children are not diverted from other worthwhile activities But in homes in which family members are preoccupied with the computer especially the Internet time spent communicating and enjoying joint leisure activities declines Therefore the computers value for acquiring new skills and information must be weighed against its potential for detracting from adultchild dialogues and other family activities Childrens opportunities to engage in developmentenhancing makebelieve and game play are at risk in yet another way Their lives are often heavily organized and scheduled Many leave preschool childcare and primaryschool settings which may not recognize the value of play for lateafternoon lessons and adultorganized sports leagues Contributing to the rise in these adultdirected activities is a decline in neighborhood safety making parents unwilling to allow their children to gather outside without supervision In many American communities childorganized games handed down from one generation to the nextfor example red rover statues blind mans buff leapfrog and endless variants on popular sportsare a thing of the past Some experts worry that adultstructured athletics are robbing children of crucial learning experiences that accrue from spontaneous game play When adults control childrens games place heavy pressure on them to win and assign them to specic roles so they lose the opportunity to experiment with rules and strategies then the arguments of critics are valid Furthermore children who join teams so earlyby ages or that the physical cognitive and social skills demanded are well beyond their current capabilities usually lose interest and want to drop out And parents and coaches who criticize rather than encourage and do not let players forget about defeat prompt intense anxiety in some youngsters Eventually those children may avoid athletics entirelyTo safeguard childrens learning and enthusiasm makebelieve play rather than organized sports is best for preschoolers When children are ready for game play permitting them to select sports they enjoy to progress at their own pace and to participate in decisions about team rules preserves the positive lessons discussed in this chapterin cooperation fair play and willingly following social rules Finally practice times must be adjusted to childrens attention spans and need for unstructured time with family and peers Two practices a week each no longer than thirty minutes is sufficient for to yearoldsBy observing childrens play themes we can discover much about the values and identities that our cultureby way of homes childcare centers schools and community youth activitiestransmits to the next generation As leaders in childrens development parents and teachers are in a prime position to design and inuence childrens play worlds in ways that shield them from acquiring materialistic and violent attitudes and behaviors and that accentuate plays cognitive emotional and social benets Vygotskys theory reminds us that as long as we think carefully about the play materials we offer the style and content of adultchild play and the social skills we encourage in childrens peer relations makebelieve play can nurture a wide range of capacities essential for academic social and laterlife success In this chapter I take up dilemmas that todays parents face in rearing young children Throughout this book we have touched on myriad forces that make contemporary parenting highly challenging These include onesided contradictory messages in the parentingadvice literature career pressures that impinge on parent involvement in childrens lives abysmally weak American childcare services to assist employed parents in their childrearing roles cultural violence and excessive materialism permeating childrens worlds schools with less than optimal conditions for childrens learning and impediments to granting children with decits and disabilities social experiences that maximize their development Contemporary parents do not just nd child rearing more difficult they feel more uncertainty than their predecessors about whether and how to intervene in their childrens activities and behavior In the pages that follow I draw on major themes of this bookthe power of adult warmth appropriate expectations narrative conversation makebelieve play and teaching in the zoneto show how Vygotskys sociocultural approach can serve as a guide for resolving a great many childrearing concerns This chapter answers twenty questions drawn from a survey of over four hundred parents of to yearolds living in a Midwestern city with a population of one hundred thousand In that survey I asked parents to list any questions about young childrens development and learning that interested or worried them The questions I answer here address issues that appeared most often in parents responses Each represents a concern that surfaced in three or more parental repliesI intend these answers to parents questions to reect a way of thinking about child rearing not a set of recipes for dealing with specic events When parents are familiar with principles that are grounded in contemporary theory and research on childrens development they can better deal with the quandaries generated by the changing home school and community contexts in which todays children grow up Although adverse cultural trends have complicated and threatened good child rearing parentsas agents of change buffers against stressful life circumstances and gatekeepers of learning opportunitiescan do much to protect restore and reshape childrens experiencesMy yearold doesnt think very well of himself Is poor selfesteem a major cause of learning problems How can I increase my childs selfesteem Should I be praising him moreWhen we speak of selfesteem we refer to the judgments we make of our own worth and the feelings associated with those judgments People with high selfesteem although recognizing their limitations are fundamentally satised with their characteristics and competencies Their selfcondence selfrespect and realistic appraisal of their current skills fortify them in the face of failure motivating them to try hard to surmount challenges By the school years individual differences in selfesteem are clearly evident and strongly related to childrens everyday behaviors That is most schoolage children are quite good at judging their own strengths and limitations For example children who agree with such statements as Im good at schoolwork tend to achieve well academically children who concur that most kids like me get along well with their classmates and children who say that theyre usually the one chosen for games are more advanced in physical skills Many parents sense this strong link between childrens selfesteem and accomplishment Consequently they may try to build their childs selfesteem with praise and reassuring commentsAlthough selfesteem and favorable development are related high selfesteem does not necessarily cause effortful behavior and achievement Rather to help sustain good outcomes selfesteem must be earned through commitment responsibility and mastery of meaningful skills Children whose parents combine warmth with reasonable expectations for mature behavior feel especially good about themselves Warm parenting lets children know that adults believe they can succeed And rm but appropriate expectations prompt children to strive for attainable goals and to use those goals as reasonable standards against which to evaluate their behaviorParents who deliver praise not based on real attainment actually undermine their childs development It does not take long for most children to see through these false compliments and to question their selfworth For others this unconditional parental acceptance may contribute to an unrealistic overly inated sense of selfesteem which is also linked to adjustment problems In one study second and third graders identied by their teachers as frequently teasing starting ghts with and excluding other children were far more likely than their classmates to rate themselves as perfect on a selfesteem questionnaire Their distorted view of their own competence appeared to undermine any motivation to improve their social behaviorJust as parents cant solve a childs motivational and selfesteem difficulties through indiscriminate praise they also cant do so through critical impatient remarks or harsh forceful tactics as in Youre lazy Why dont you try hard like your sister Do that homework or youll be punished These strategies spark anger and resentment in children and undermine a positive parentchild relationship on which motivation and effort thrive And they destroy selfesteem by conveying a sense of inadequacy to childrenthat their behavior needs to be controlled by adults because they are unable to manage it themselves Instead parents can foster high but realistic selfesteem by asking themselves three crucial questionsAre the demands I make of my child within his or her zoneneither too high nor too lowHave I forged a warm parentchild relationship so my child is fueled with the desire to meet my expectationsHave I used rm but encouraging tacticsscaffolding of academic tasks to promote autonomous mastery narrative conversation about the importance of trying hard to convey strong workethic values and joint participation in routines and duties such as meal preparation and household chores to assist in developing responsibilityFinally children dont need to feel great about everything they try None of us is adept in every area Rather during the school years selfesteem differentiates into an array of selfevaluations For example children judge themselves to be good at some school subjects and physical skills but not so good at others Eventually they combine these separate selfevaluations into a general appraisalan overall sense of selfesteem It remains positive so long as the child feels that he or she is competent at some worthwhile skills In sum the route to favorable selfesteem lies in parents encouragement of achievement and responsibility Then children have something worth feeling good about Praise should be tied to real progress and attainment Encouraging words are particularly helpful when children are trying their best but gains in performance are hard won And most children greatly appreciate a parents congratulations for a job well done Positive selfjudgments formed in these ways foster continued effort and mastery which in turn promote high selfesteemHow much television and what kinds of programs should I permit my preschool child to watch The typical preschool child devotes nearly percent of his or her waking hours to watching television a gure that rises to percent by school age Clearly todays children spend far too many hours in front of the TV set a circumstance that restricts time available for joint parentchild activities play reading and other worthwhile pursuits Television is so pervasive an inuence in childrens lives that I discussed it at length in Chapter Parents are wise to limit childrens access to TV to about one to oneandahalf hours a dayno more than hours a week Following that guideline would cut the exorbitant number of hours children spend watching TV by to percent Parents also need to prohibit violent TV and orient children toward educational programs that inform them about their world and toward entertainment shows that teach positive values and social skills In Chapter I explained how readily children can pick up negative attitudes and behaviors from television Fortunately children can just as easily absorb worthwhile messages and information from TV so parental guidance in this area can have great benets for developmentIn Chapter I also noted that it is crucial for parents to model good viewing practices to watch TV with children helping them understand and evaluate what they see and to use televised content as inspiration for makebelieve play and other enriching activities Another suggestion Try not to use television to reward or punish children This increases its attractiveness making children want to watch all the moreMy monthold daughter and husband enjoy going to the Public Broadcasting System website Im delighted that they spend time together but the whole computer concept makes me nervous Already my daughter bangs on the keys and uses the mouse How much is too much and how young is too young More than half of American families own a personal computer and onethird of these have access to the Internetrates that are growing rapidly Its not surprising that even very young children are attracted to the computeroften more so than to television As one schoolage child commented Its fun because you can control it TV controls itself Your keybanging mouseclicking monthold already seems to appreciate this sense of electronic controlAs I noted in Chapter the computer like TV has just as much potential for good as for ill Hence its another alluring device that requires close parental monitoring and interventionto prevent children from becoming addictive users from immersing themselves in violent genderstereotyped video games and from accessing websites and web pages with sexual aggressive or other inappropriate contentUndoubtedly father and daughter are beneting greatly from their time together at the computer The warmth exploration conversation and fun involved in this and other joint parentchild activities strengthen emotional bonds and foster both cognitive and social development But such an early introduction to the computer is not necessary Young children orient to computers because they frequently see adults using these stimulating devices so they want to do so tooAlmost all American publicschool classrooms have at least one computer and many preschools have them as well But for the computer to enhance learning in early childhood adults must guide children in its constructive use and help them acquire computerliteracy skills Around years of age children can type in simple commands and play educational games Although they like the computer most preschoolers do not nd it so captivating that it diverts them from other worthwhile activities A common parental worry is that computers will channel children into solitary pursuits and disrupt their social development To the contrary children generally prefer to use computers socially At home they often like to engage in computer activities with a parent or older sibling because they can do much more with the help of an expert partner And at school small groups often gather around the machine to solve problems collaborativelyHow can parents capitalize on the computers potential for spurring their childs development A variety of educational software is available that permits children to practice academic skills and acquire new knowledge through discovery learning reasoning and problem solving As soon as children begin to read and write they can use the computer for word processing It permits them to write freely without having to struggle with handwriting and they can plan and revise their work easily As a result young writers worry less about making mistakes and their written products are longer and of higher quality However computers by themselves do not help children master the mechanics of writing such as spelling and grammar Consequently they are best used to build on not replace other writing experiencesBeginning in the late preschool years children can learn to program Specially designed computer languages such as LOGO are available for this purpose As long as adults provide the necessary scaffold children benet greatly from programming experiences They not only acquire a valuable new skill but master new concepts become better problem solvers and think more creatively Also since children must detect errors in their programs to get them to work programming helps them reect on their thinking and regulate their own behaviorHow much is too much and how young is too young Theres no evidence that computer experiences make toddlers more skilled computer users or thinkers By kindergarten and primary school children can gain much from computer activities As far as how much computer time parents should permit the answer depends on what children are doing When they are involved in writing problem solving or other educational pursuits theres no special reason to be very restrictive But not all software called educational is the same quality so parents are wise to evaluate what their children are learning Moreover parents must ensure that time at the computer does not interfere with the variety of experiences children need to learn at their best And playing violent video games and freely accessing the Internet should be prohibitedHow many and what kinds of toys does a young child need My yearold son is attracted to guns and war toys How should I handle this type of playMartha Bronsons The Right Stuff for Children Birth to is as an excellent resource for selecting play materials that provide children of varying ages with both pleasure and an appropriate challenge On pages to of Chapter I provided an overview of playmaterial suggestions for stimulating makebelieve and game play in children between and years of age In Bronsons book youll nd additional recommendations organized into four broad playactivity categories social and fantasy play exploration and cognitive mastery music art and movement and gross motor playChildrens rooms and play spaces need not be lled with every toy imaginable A modest number of toys is sufficient Children who have too much typically care little for what they have When given a chance to acquire something new they usually dont react with much excitement or selectivity For materially indulged children new toys are such a common event that a complacent attitude sets in The child comes to think if I dont like what I just got I can always discard it for something else A bedroom or playroom heaped high with a jumble of toys many broken and mistreated also teaches children that possessions need not be cared for and respected Parents often assume that the play materials children choose are the ones that are best for their development To some degree this assumption makes sense If a toy isnt appealing to the child the child isnt going to spend time with it So its important to provide children with a variety of play materials responsive to their interestsNevertheless preference is not the same as appropriateness Children sometimes choose toys with very limited play possibilities and soon ignore them Other toys should not be given to children because they encourage undesirable play behaviors Guns and other forms of weaponry fall into this category In Chapter I pointed to research demonstrating that these aggressive play materials promote both makebelieve and real hostility in childrens interactions with peersWhen thinking about purchasing a new toy for your child ask yourself these questions Does my child already have too many toys and am I adding to this overabundance Is the toy responsive to my childs interests and is it likely to sustain his or her involvement over time Do I want my child to acquire the values and skills the toy teaches How will the toy help provide a foundation for my childs future learning and developmentIm expecting a new baby How much is too much information for a yearold about pregnancy and childbirthIts easy to tell preschool and young schoolage children too much about pregnancy and childbirthmore than they are capable of understanding The best approach is to respond to their questions with simple direct answers The younger the preschooler the less likely he or she is to notice the pregnant mothers growing tummy and to be interested in how the baby got in there Such questions as Where do babies come from Where did I come from and How does a baby get born rarely occur before age When children do ask these questions parents vary widely in how much information they are comfortable in providing Up to age or most children are satised with such general explanations as it starts as a little seed inside the mother which grows into a baby grows in a special space in the mothers tummy called a uterus and when the babys ready to be born the mothers uterus squeezes and squeezes and the baby comes out Some parents show their child books with pictures of fetuses identifying those that are about the same age as the forthcoming sibling and discussing the babys development as it progresses Theres no evidence that this is in any way harmful or that its necessary during early childhood rather its a matter of parental choiceEight to yearolds are ready for more detailed knowledge about how babies are conceived and grow as children of this age are getting closer to puberty A variety of wellwritten and illustrated books are available to help parents discuss love between partners conception birth and rearing of children Parents need to select carefully making sure they agree with the books values Two books that I like are How Babies Are Made by Andrew Audrey and Steven Schep and Where Did I Come From by Peter Mayle How I Was Adopted by Joanna Cole is an excellent starting point for discussion with preschool and young schoolage children who are adoptedI dont believe in spanking We do time outs which seem to work for our yearold How long is time out effective and whats the next stepAlthough spanking has declined over the past years the majority of parents in the United States admit to slapping or hitting their child for misbehaving There is good reason not to believe in spanking A great deal of research shows that it promotes only temporary compliance not lasting changes in childrens behavior Children who are repeatedly criticized shouted at and slapped are likely to display the unacceptable response again as soon as adults are out of sight and they can get away with it In fact children of harshly punishing parents develop into especially disobedient and aggressive youngsters In a study of a national sample of over twelve hundred mothers of to yearolds psychologists Murray Straus David Sugarman and Jean GilesSims found that the more spanking the mothers reported the more antisocial behavior their children displayed two years latercheating telling lies being mean to classmates and disobeying teachersWhy doesnt spanking work First when parents spank they often do so in response to childrens deance and aggression Yet the punishment itself models aggression Second children who are frequently punished soon learn to avoid the punishing adult When children evade their parents they reduce parents opportunity to teach desirable behaviors Finally as spanking works to stop childrens misbehavior temporarily it offers immediate relief to parents which rewards them for spanking For this reason the parent is likely to spank with greater frequency and intensity over time a course of action that can spiral into serious abuseThis does not mean that parents should never express anger at or punish a child An otherwise warm parent who is disappointed and disapproving lets the child know that the transgression is serious When children realize that adults regard their misdeed as very important they listen more closely And punishment is warranted after repeated infractions But parents have far better ways to punish than spanking One of these is time outrequiring a child to sit aside or to go to his or her room Another is withdrawal of privileges such as a visit to the playground or a weekly allowance These mild punishments derive their potency from warm parentchild bonds Children of involved caring parents nd the interruption in parental affection that accompanies punishment to be very unpleasant As a result they want to regain the warmth and approval of the parent as quickly as possibleAn important preventive of misbehaviorand a vital element of effective punishmentis explanation Pairing reasons with mild punishment such as time out leads to a far greater reduction in rule violations than using punishment alone The reason the adult gives the child must match the childs capacity to understand At ages to referring to simple direct outcomes works best as in If you keep pushing Tommy hell fall down and cry By age parents can give more complex and subtle explanations For example they can refer to others intentions Dont yell at Jessica She was only trying to help to others feelings Hes proud of his tower and you knocked it down now hes very sad and to issues of rights and fairness That toy belongs to Rudy so you must ask for a turnExplaining to children what they did wrong why it was wrong and how they should have acted helps them recall the misdeed and relate it to expectations for future behavior Furthermore by pointing out the impact of the childs actions on others parents prompt children to feel empathy and sympathyemotions that motivate concern for others And giving children reasons for changing their behavior invites them to judge the appropriateness of parents expectationsto see that parents are not being arbitrary or autocratic Explanations lead children to strive to meet parental standards because those standards make senseIn sum when time out is combined with reasoning it remains effective through the school years You can tell that your approach to discipline is working when time out and other punishments become less necessary as your child shifts from externally controlled responses to behavior based on inner standards and compassion for others Typically this shift is well under way between ages and If parents nd themselves punishing frequently then they need to reconsider the basis of their discipline When sensitivity cooperation and exchanges of affection are evident in parentchild interaction children as young as years of age more often follow parental directives Children with an affectionate mutually gratifying parental tie want to heed parents demands because they feel a sense of commitment to the relationship This reduces the need for punishment freeing parents to focus on encouraging childrens competent behaviorThree additional ways to avoid excessive punishment are worth mentioning First changing aspects of the environment can reduce childrens problematic behavior One parent arranged for her younger child to play at a friends house during his sisters birthday party realizing that the boy wasnt yet ready to join in the partys activities and would likely disrupt them Second a close look at the reasonableness of the rules can be helpful Another parent caught herself before yelling Dont roll down that hill at her daughter She realized that the child was unlikely to hurt herself on the gentle grassy slope and that any grassstained clothing could easily be washed With a moment of reection the parent backed off from an almostdelivered rebuke to allow a pleasurable play activity Finally sensitivity to childrens physical and emotional resources helps prevent inappropriate punishment When children are tired ill or bored they are likely to engage in attentiongetting disorganized or otherwise improper behavior as a reaction to discomfort rather than as an affront to authority In these instances meeting the childs needs makes more sense than punishing Whats the best way to deal with repeated tantrums in a yearold child who gets so enraged that he hits and throws things at you How can you calm a preschooler when the situation requires him to listen and pay attentionWhen a tantrum occurs time out is usefultransferring the child to an unstimulating area where he cant throw things until the emotional storm is over If he tries to throw anything or to hit you you need to prevent him from doing so gently but rmly Its crucial to remain calm and to avoid harsh coercive tactics which will only fuel the childs rage and poor emotional controlIts also important to gure out why these persistent tantrums are occurring As the oftenheard phrase terrible twos suggests many people assume that tantrums are a fact of life for and even yearolds Once toddlers acquire the ability to follow adult directives one way they assert their autonomy is by resisting parents requests and demands using the familiar refrain No And from time to time toddlers lose control When frustrated they havent yet developed many techniques for regulating their emotions But parents who take mental notes for a day on the number of compliant acts versus the number of tantrums are likely to gain a new appreciation for how infrequent their childs tantrums really are For most young children eager willing cooperation is much more common than oppositionIf your child has been emotionally reactive and difficult to soothe since infancy then temperament is probably a signicant contributor to his behavior Youll also want to consider whether any changes in your family or the childs daily life might be sparking intense anxietymarital conict divorce or remarriage a new baby brother or sister starting preschool or child care or a parent going to work when the child is used to having him or her at home Parenting practices can modify childrens temperaments and assist them in coping with stressful life events Protection from family discord extra parental warmth affection and pleasurable time together when the child is behaving well and rm calm and consistent discipline will help Most children build up to a tantrum gradually Parents can tell its in the offing and sometimes they can distract the child before it reaches a peak For example if the child is about to blow while youre out shopping try involving the child in the shopping experiencepointing out things of interest to the child asking the child to help you select and carry purchases and reminding the child that after the shopping is nished you are going to do something the child enjoys When parents interrupt a tantrum on the rise by redirecting the childs attention they provide strategies children can use on their own to regulate emotion If parents always wait to intervene after the child has become intensely distressed its harder not only for the parent to calm the child but for the child to learn to calm down And once the child regains emotional control reassuring the child of parental love with hugs and comforting words restores the parentchild relationship and strengthens the childs sense of securityMakebelieve play is an effective context in which preschoolers can practice what to do when frustrated Parent and child can take turns acting out the parent and child roles While playing the child the parent can get upset Then parent and child can come up with ways to help the child control intense feelings Occasionally during makebelieve children send parents clear messages about disciplinary tactics they want and need to quell tantrums In one instance Sonja a mother at wits end over her yearold daughter Merediths frequent ts of kicking and screaming consulted a child psychologist The psychologist had Meredith play the mother and Sonja play the child When the child asked for a cookie the mother said No cookies before dinner You can have a cookie after dinnerSonja the child began to mimic her daughters tantrums I want a cookie I want two cookies Gimme my cookies she shoutedNo Meredith the mother answered No cookies until after dinnerI want cookies now Sonja the child wailed while thrashing about in Merediths usual fashionMeredith looked on dismayed by her mothers unruly behavior Then she stepped out of the play and instructed Youre supposed to say No cookies til later MommyWhen Sonja the child continued her screaming and crying Meredith stated more insistently Mommy say No cookies You cant have cookies before dinnerWith the psychologists help Sonja reected on the play episode realizing that shed been inconsistent in handling Merediths outbursts sometimes resisting at other times giving in As a result Meredith continued the tantrums to get her way yet she desperately wanted to stop these explosions and to follow sensible consistent rules To do so she needed her mother to send a clear rational and steadfast message that tantrums are inappropriate and ineffectual and that cookies are eaten after dinnerWhat suggestions do you have for disciplining a strongwilled stubborn child Nothing seems to work including time out and loss of privilegesAs this question makes clear some children are far harder to discipline than others A childs temperament affects the ease with which he or she will follow parental directives and listen to explanations In Chapter I indicated that the impulsivity and emotional reactivity of children with ADHD make them very hard to rear and often lead to striferidden adultchild relationships which further reduce childrens cooperation Willful stubborn children are also challenging to discipline They tend to evoke harsh punishment which heightens their resistance A seemingly stubborn child may feel so little anxiety that parental disapproval and mild punishment do not spark enough inner discomfort to motivate compliance Consequently parents of headstrong children must use rm consistent discipline and repeatedly explain how to behave and why At the same time such parents must resist the temptation to engage in carping criticism harshness and force A warm parentchild bond based on cooperation is especially vital for helping recalcitrant children internalize parents standards It provides the obstinate youngster who feels little or no anxiety when reprimanded with an alternative foundation for meeting parents expectations a desire to preserve a spirit of affection and harmony with the parentBecause parents communication with noncompliant children is often riddled with negativity it can take time to get the relationship on a better track Arranging regular times for joint parentchild pleasurable activities is vital Making sure to notice and praise the childs favorable behavior also reduces the negative cloud hanging over parentchild interaction Finally looking for the silver lining in the childs difficult disposition can help parents muster the fortitude needed to rear a child with a difficult disposition Consider Carl one of the most obstinate participants in a study of the combined impact that temperament and child rearing have on longterm development Beginning in infancy Carl rejected many routines and experiences including baths bedtime and new foods He shrieked cried and struggled to get away Yet his parents regarded his emotional intensity as a sign of inner strength and vigor They believed that if they were patient and rmly insistent Carl would in the end adapt positivelyBy the time Carl reached school age he was doing remarkably well The energies he had previously invested in stubborn rebellion were channeled constructively He did well in school and became enthusiastically involved in several activities One of these was playing the pianolessons that he had asked for but in his typical fashion at rst disliked intensely Carls mother had granted his request for piano instruction under one condition that he stick to the lessons for six months She held him to this agreement despite his protests which gradually subsided Carl came to love his introduction to music His parents warmth determination and consistency had helped him gain control of his behavior and benet from new learning opportunitiesHow can you get an inactive child who loves quiet play to be more active and sociableParents of quiet children often wonder whether their youngster is developing normally Preschoolers whose play and behavior are typically mature for their age but who prefer solitary tranquil activities are probably doing just ne both cognitively and socially As I indicated in Chapter only certain kinds of nonsocial activityaimless wandering immature repetitive motor action and anxious hovering around peers without joining in their playare cause for concern Most play of quiet preschoolers is not of this kind Instead it is positive and constructive consisting of such activities as art makebelieve play puzzles and blockbuildingOur society places such a high value on sociability that adults often regard quiet reserve as a sign of maladjustment Yet not all cultures see things this way Chinese adults for example view quiet children very positivelyas advanced in social maturity Thai primaryschool teachers also value restrained persistent child behavior and they regard children who would be average in activity level in the United States as poorly behaved and unmotivated Equating an energetic pace and gregariousness with normality is a Western cultural phenomenonone that does not match what we know about quiet nonanxious children Most are bright youngsters with intense interests who when they do play with peers show socially skilled behaviorNevertheless you might want to encourage a quiet inactive child to engage in active play from time to timeto ensure healthy exercise and to broaden the childs experiences The best way to do this is to join the child in active games such as tag relay races hideandseek and throwing and catching Creating a zone for learningby ensuring that active play is fun provides plenty of opportunity to practice physical skills and is not overstimulating for the quiet childwill increase the success of these efforts You wont be able to transform a quiet child into a physical dynamo but you can help the child learn to enjoy moderate physical activity Finally parents of quiet children may be gratied to learn that a calm less active nature typically makes a child easier to rearHow does a parent gain respect from a child who sees the other parent acting disrespectfully toward his or her spouseChildren learn much about how to relate to others by observing their parents daytoday communication Marital conict is linked to hostile behavior and poor emotional adjustment in children including feeling sad and engaging in aggressive acts Hearing one or both parents berate the other leads children to act similarlytoward parents siblings teachers and peers If disrespect between parents includes physical harm then childrens difficulties can escalate furtherBesides modeling destructive forms of interaction parents who behave hurtfully toward each other generally interact hostilely with their children They also tend to use inconsistent disciplinealternately strict and lax When parents scold children on some occasions but permit them to act inappropriately on others children are confused about how to behave and engage in especially high rates of disobedienceIn sum parents behaving insolently to each other are up against a brick wall in getting a child to behave respectfully They need to repair their relationship Seeking the help of a marriage and family counselor without delay is the best way to prevent the childs emotionally despondent and angry reactions from spiraling into lasting adjustment problems Any tips on raising an only childThe best way for parents to ensure that only children fare well is to engage them in developmentenhancing dialogues to impose reasonable expectations for mature behavior and to discipline effectively Overall parents of only children are quite successful in attaining these childrearing goals Contrary to popular belief only children are not destined to become spoiled and selsh Instead research consistently shows that they are as well adjusted and as socially competent as other children And they form just as close and as rewarding friendships as do children with siblings suggesting that they can and do learn to share and to be considerate of others needs Furthermore only children have a more positive sense of selfesteem and do better in school than do children growing up in families with two or more children A major reason for these positive outcomes is that having just one child generally means a closer parentchild relationship more time for highquality parentchild interaction and greater encouragement for mastery and accomplishment But because only children lose the lifelong benets of positive sibling ties parents might take steps to enrich the childs life with siblinglike relationshipsfor example by cultivating warm bonds with cousins or the children of close family friends In sum with good parenting only children fare extremely wellHow can you keep a childs selfesteem high while still praising a siblings achievements and good behavior When a child acts out because of sibling jealousy whats the best way to handle it Children display wide individual differences in the quality of their sibling ties Once again temperament makes a difference For example arguments between siblings increase when one child is emotionally intense and highly active But parents can do much to foster favorable sibling interaction During the preschool years mothers tend to be more positive and playful with secondborns than rstborns and they discipline the older child more This differential treatment is understandable in that older children are more competent and capable so parents expect more But being older also means more privilegesfor example being able to stay overnight at a friends house or enroll in certain afterschool activities and lessons These advantages may help compensate for an older childs perception that a younger sibling is receiving better treatment If parents experience intensifying sibling conict they may want to reevaluate their communication with each child Warmth and frequent expressions of affection are associated with positive sibling interaction whereas harshness and coldness are associated with sibling antagonism Once established this link between parentchild and sibling relationships is selfperpetuating Warm parenting fosters considerate sibling interaction which prompts positive parental communication in the future When parents are hostile and coercive children act similarly toward their siblings and parental anger escalatesThe elementary school years are a time when sibling conict can increase As children get feedback about how well they are doing in school and in other activities such as sports and music lessons parents may compare their accomplishments especially when siblings are close in age and the same gender The child who feels less valued is likely to resent a sibling whom parents seem to prefer Therefore when praising one child parents should try not to diminish the merits of another If a sibling expresses jealousy parents can remind the envious child of an admirable personal trait or a recent commendable performance But be careful not to give empty praise not based on real accomplishment which children quickly come to mistrust It may fuel jealousy of a sibling whom the child concludes parents really appreciateIn sum parents can foster positive sibling ties through expressing warmth and affection stressing each childs positive qualities and achievements and refraining from making comparisons When sibling relationships are friendly and sympathetic they bring many benets including gratifying companionship emotional support and assistance with everyday tasksShould you try to curb bossy behavior when siblings or peers are playing together If so at what ageYes you should step in and teach alternative cooperative modes of interactionat as early an age as you observe bossiness A child who has trouble engaging in give and take during play with siblings or peers will quickly become embroiled in conictAs I noted in Chapter pleasurable rewarding play depends on attaining intersubjectivity or shared understanding Children must resolve differences of opinion and nd ways to meet both their own needs and those of their playmates When domineering uncooperative behavior is extreme the bossy child is likely to be rejected by agemates Longterm peer rejection as I indicated in Chapter not only leads to an unhappy social life but to serious adjustment problems in adolescence and early adulthoodWhen a child uses bossy tactics interrupt the play and ask the child to think of a better way to get others to cooperate such as making requests and taking into account the playmates preferences If the child cant think of alternatives suggest and model several If bossiness continues unabated insist that the child leave the play area explaining why he or she must do so During times when youre alone with the child talk about problems that have arisen in peer and sibling play and help the child think of good social problemsolving strategies Then act out these situations in makebelieve granting the child plenty of practice in applying effective social skills and showing the child how others are likely to react if bossy behavior returnsHow can a parent identify the difference between a language disorder and normal language development What resources are availableIf your childs language development is delayed by several months when compared to norms for early language milestones then your child might have a language disorder But keep in mind that children vary greatly in their pace of language learning For example girls are slightly ahead of boys in early vocabulary growth and reserved cautious children often wait until they understand a great deal before trying to speak When they nally do speak their vocabularies grow rapidly Here is a summary of major language milestones for the rst yearsApproximate AgeMilestone months Coos or makes pleasurable vowel sounds such as aaaaa or oooo monthsBabbles or repeats consonantvowel sounds in long strings as in babababababa monthsBabbled sounds expand greatly around year they reect the sounds and rhythms of the infants language community monthsUnderstands some words monthsSays rst recognizable word monthsVocabulary expands from about to words monthsCombines two words months and onSpeaks in longer sentences participates easily in a conversation with an adult Because of wide individual differences its sometimes hard to tell a language disorder from normal variation in language development If youre concerned about your childs language progress consult a trained speechlanguage pathologist The American SpeechLanguageHearing Association ASHA maintains a list of certied speechlanguage pathologists for referrals You can contact the association at The most common cause of early language problems is a hearing loss Typically children with hearing impairments are not identied until to months of age when speech and language development is already delayed Therefore ASHA recommends that all newborn babies be screened for hearing disorders before they leave the hospital Newborn testing takes only a few minutes and permits problems to be addressed early preventing negative consequences for all aspects of psychological developmentHearing loss can also emerge later The most common cause during toddlerhood and the preschool years is repeated otitis media or middle ear infection Some episodes are painful so parents detect them but many are accompanied by few or no symptoms Children with recurrent otitis media bouts have trouble making out what others are saying Hence they are distractible behind in language progress and socially isolated and they also achieve poorly in school When children begin preschool or child care they are more susceptible to otitis media because of close contact with other children Therefore frequent screening for the disease followed by prompt medical intervention is vital Interestingly verbally stimulating adultchild interaction and highquality child care help reduce developmental problems associated with otitis media When adults converse often with children and keep environmental noise to a minimum children with persistent ear infections have more opportunities to hear and respond to spoken languageIm trying to decide whether to enroll my yearold son in kindergarten or wait until next year How can I tell if hes ready for kindergarten If he doesnt do well in kindergarten should he repeat it or go into a transition classMany parents struggle with the decision of whether to enroll their child in kindergarten once the child meets the age requirements Most often they consider delaying the start of school for boys who as a group tend to lag behind girls in cognitive and social development At the heart of parents concern is whether their child will be able to meet the academic and social demands of the kindergarten classroomAlthough many teachers believe that a yearold whos on the young side can benet from waiting another year before enrolling in kindergarten and advise parents to hold the child out research has not revealed any advantages for delayed entry A host of studies indicate that younger children make just as much progress academically and socially as do older children enrolled in the same grade No difference exists between younger and older classmates in achievement test scores A related dilemma involves whether to retain a kindergartner for a second kindergarten year if he or she is not progressing well More than a halfcentury of research has failed to show any learning benets for children retained in grade and mounting evidence indicates that retention can be harmful prompting negative attitudes toward school and a drop in selfesteem and in academic motivation even as early as kindergarten In one study retained kindergarten children despite the extra year of school scored lower than their classmates in academic achievement after entering the primary grades In contrast children recommended for retention but who nevertheless went on to rst grade were doing just as well as classmates who had been promoted in the standard fashionYet another alternative is to place a poorly performing kindergarten child in a transition classa waystation between kindergarten and rst grade Transition classes however are a form of homogeneous grouping that gathers children judged by the school system as less likely to succeed As with other lowability groups teachers often have lower expectations for transitionclass students and teach them in a less stimulating fashion than they do other children Notice that each of the options just mentioned assumes that readiness is inherent in the childthat a yearold must have reached a certain level of development to prot from classroom experiences Consider once again the concept of the zone in which teaching leads development It tells us that children dont just grow into school readiness Rather they acquire the knowledge skills and attitudes necessary for successfully participating in classroom life through the assistance of others This means that readiness is not something we must wait for Instead we can cultivate it Parents teachers and school systems can work together to ensure that each child takes the next appropriate steps toward mastering the range of capabilities needed for school successThe National Association for the Education of Young Children NAEYC recommends that every child of legal age start kindergarten It also recommends against school readiness testing as a means for deciding whether a child should be admitted to kindergarten be retained in kindergarten or enroll in a transition class rather than a rstgrade class after completing kindergarten School readiness tests are poor predictors of childrens future school performance and identify many children as unready who are quite ready to handle school experiences As long as teachers are sensitive to childrens diversity and work with small groups and individual children within their zones there is no reason to hold a child out of kindergarten Deciding not to enroll a child and opting for an alternative experience is justiable only when the kindergarten environment is so rigid and unaccommodating to individual differences that the child would be frustrated and unhappy and would have an unproductive year My first grader has homework to do several times a week Should I help her with her homework and if so how should I do soAmerican parents often express uncertainty about helping their child with homework They worry that by providing help they will discourage selfreliance in thinking and problem solving Vygotskys concept of the zone underscores that children acquire the many capacities they need to learn autonomously from the assistance of parents teachers and other more expert adults By collaborating with the child on a challenging task the adult assesses what the child can already do and what the child is ready to learn providing a support system for masteryThe metaphor of a scaffold discussed in Chapter is an excellent guide for how to help your child with homework Scaffolding involves varying your assistance to t the childs changing competence When the child says I dont understand you can adjust the task breaking it into smaller parts You can also provide prompts hints and explanations increasing the amount and directiveness of your guidance until the child makes progress As you do so you can assist the child in analyzing why certain problemsolving approaches work and others do not encouraging her to come up with ideas for surmounting difficulties As she starts to apply the strategies derived from your dialogue you can reduce the intensity of your intervention letting her take over responsibility for the taskToo often parents imagine that their childs classmates can do the homework assignment independently After all they say to themselves why would the teacher have assigned it if this werent so This pattern of reasoning leads parents down a counterproductive path Whats wrong with my child they say to themselves She should be able to do the assignment just like everyone else But recall that children of the same age differ widely in their zones And rooted in the very idea of the zone is that learning requires teaching Children in our culture frequently are rebuked for seeking help a response that promotes dependency helplessness and retreat from challenge not competence and autonomy Chinese and Japanese parents spend a great deal of time helping their children with homeworkfar more than American parents do Asian parents also communicate often with teachers about how to help their child learn at his or her best Rather than being dependent Chinese and Japanese students develop into well adjusted excellent studentsat the top in academic achievement in the world When does math become a greater problem for girls than for boys What can be done to help girls do well in mathThroughout elementary school girls get better grades in mathand other academic subjectsthan do boys At times schoolage boys outperform girls on math achievement tests but boys advantage in math isnt clearly evident until secondary school A close look at childrens performance on specic test items reveals that both genders do equally well in basic math knowledge and girls do better in computational skills Boys advantage appears on tests of math reasoning primarily on complex word problems and in geometryThe cause of boys lateappearing math advantage is a matter of controversy Some experts believe the difference is rooted in boys superior ability to reason about spatial relations Gender differences in spatial skills are present by elementary school and persist throughout life Young people who are good at spatial reasoning are indeed better at solving complex math problems One conjecture is that male androgen hormones may play some role in enhancing boys spatial skills But evidence favoring this idea is inconsistentAlthough heredity may contribute to boys spatial superiority experience also makes a difference Children who engage in manipulative activities involving spatial relations such as block play model building and carpentry do better on spatial reasoning tasks Also playing video games that require rapid mental rotation of visual images enhances the spatial test scores of boys and girls alike Yet boys spend far more time at all these pursuits than do girlsFurthermore childrens and adolescents attitudes toward math and their belief in their capacity to do well at it affect their math achievement Boys feel more condent about their math ability even when their grades are poorer than girls Why might this be soShortly after entering primary school children regard math as a boys subjecta stereotype that prompts girls to like math less than boys do Girls also predict poorer math performances for themselves than boys predict for themselves Children derive these views from their social surroundings They listen to what parents and teachers say about who is good at math and they see more men in mathrelated careersfrom math teachers in the upper school grades to scientists in the wider communityAlso subtle feedback from adults undermines girls condence in their ability to do well at math If a parent or teacher believes that a child is not very capable at a school subject the adult may act surprised when the child succeeds ascribing good performance to luck by saying something like this Gee you did a lot better than I expected And when the child fails the adult may explain the failure by referring to mediocre ability Youre not very good at that are you Girls get much more of this type of feedback than do boys especially in math In contrast parents and teachers often attribute boys poor performance to misbehavior and lack of motivation If only youd listen and try they say youd do much betterAs a result of these messages too many girls come to believe that when they succeed at math their ability didnt help them And after failure they reason that weak ability not insufficient effort was at fault Children who hold these discouraging explanations for their performance often come apart with anxiety when a task is difficult They say to themselves I cant do this Its too hard before they have really tried Although eventually young people gure out that effort can compensate for low ability girls may conclude that mastering complex math is not worth the costextremely high effort So in high school they retreat from advanced math courses and mathrelated careersFortunately parents can do much to foster girls selfcondence and achievement in math Beginning in the preschool years they can provide girls with toys and activities that promote spatial reasoning and scaffold their mastery of those tasks And they can assist children of both genders in interpreting their math successes as due to both effort and ability in understanding that ability accrues from trying hard and in taking failure as a sign that more effort and better problemsolving strategies are needed A positive sign is that the gap between boys and girls math achievement is declining In addition more girls are enrolling in advanced math and science courses in high school and slowly but steadily women are entering maledominated mathrelated professions The more parents hold nonstereotyped values about what males and females can and should do the more likely girls are to sustain their high elementaryschool math and science achievement in secondary schoolWhy do boys lag behind girls in reading and writing in primary school Do they catch up laterThroughout the school years girls attain higher scores on reading and writing achievement tests and account for a lower percentage of children referred for remedial reading instruction Part of the reason for girls advantage in literacy development is that they undergo a faster rate of physical maturation believed to promote slightly earlier development of the left hemisphere of the cerebral cortex where language functions are housed for most people In addition many types of developmental problems are more common among boys including speech and language disorders reading disabilities and inattention and hyperactivity Boys and girls differing genetic makeups probably underlie these gender differences which affect reading and writing performance By secondary school girls advantage on tests of general verbal ability is so slight that it is not really meaningful Consequently boys who are free of reading disabilities have the potential to achieve just as well as girls in reading and writing Still girls continue to outperform boys in these subjects Home and school experiences contribute although less is known about them than those that underlie boys advantage in mathematics Just as children think of math as a masculine subject they regard reading and writing as feminine subjects Parents rate daughters as more capable at reading than they rate sonsbeliefs that children adopt Furthermore traditional primaryschool classrooms in which teacherdirected wholeclass lessons are the major activity require children to sit still and concentrate for long periods of time on academic tasks that often are irrelevant to their interests In previous chapters I indicated that such classrooms are poorly suited to the learning needs of both boys and girls But boys adapt especially poorly to the regimentation of traditional classrooms because of their generally shorter attention spans higher activity levels and less compliant dispositionsConsequently they often are targets of teacher disapproval which sparks negative attitudes toward school and dampens their enthusiasm for learningIn a recent Australian study carried out by psychologist Freda Briggs several hundred schoolchildren were asked for their views on school and classroom activities Many boys between and years of age expressed dissatisfaction with school and said that their favorite activities were recess and lunchtime But in four classrooms distinguished by an activitycenter curriculum offering opportunities for individual choice smallgroup work and literacy experiences responsive to childrens interests boys reported strong liking for school And they named reading and writing as their favorite activities They particularly enjoyed making their own books based on themes of sports and hobbiesAlthough more evidence is needed to be sure perhaps classrooms that create zones for learning with many of the features I described in Chapter spark sufficient enthusiasm for literacy pursuits among boys that they reduce the wellknown gender gap in reading and writing achievement Finally the trend for boys to learn to read more slowly than girls is less pronounced in countries where reading is not stereotyped as feminine but regarded as well suited to the masculine gender roleIs learning and development affected if the father becomes less involved or absent after a divorce Divorce is invariably painful for children and learning and development can be affectedtemporarily and long term Preschool and young schoolage children are often profoundly upset Because they have great difficulty grasping the reasons for their parents divorce they may blame themselves and take the marital breakup as a sign that they could be abandoned by both parents As a result they may cry and cling refuse to go to school and show a drop in enthusiasm for play and learning Young children need extra affection and reassurance along with gentle reminders that their parents separation is permanent Of all age groups preschoolers are most likely to have trouble accepting the reality of divorce and to fantasize that their parents will get back togetherMany schoolage children and adolescents also react strongly to the end of their parents marriage particularly when family conict is high and parent involvement with children is low Around the time of divorce and for up to several years after children tend to be emotionally volatile displaying both depression and demandingness noncompliance and aggression Boys in mothercustody families seem to have the hardest time Research reveals that before the marital breakup many sons of divorcing couples were impulsive and deanttraits that may have contributed to as well as been caused by their parents marital problems Thus boys often enter the period of family turmoil surrounding divorce with behavior problems and a reduced capacity to cope with stress Custodial mothers tend to have difficulty handling sons on their own Both boys and girls show declines in academic achievement during the aftermath of divorce but school problems are greater for boysMost children improve in adjustment by two years after divorce Yet for some emotional distress and poor school performance persist contributing to lasting problems into adolescence and young adulthood Adults whose parents divorced during their childhoods tend to do less well in terms of educational vocational and economic attainment than their counterparts from stable families Regardless of whether fathers remain salient gures in childrens lives the strongest predictor of good outcomes following divorce is effective parentingcombining warmth with reasonable maturity demands limiting family conict and using consistent nonpunitive discipline Fathers who remain involved and who use good childrearing techniques contribute greatly to the psychological wellbeing of children of both genders with boys showing special benetsI have a child with physical disabilities cerebral palsy but whos very smart Will his intellectual growth continue as long as its promotedYour childs intellectual growth will denitely continue as long as you and other important adults in his life promote it Chapter of this book is devoted to the development of children with decits and disabilities Although I dont discuss children with cerebral palsy specically the same general principles for fostering continued learning in all children apply to your child Childrenwith and without disabilitiesacquire new competencies through dialogues with more expert partners who are sensitive to what the child is ready to master and foster it in culturally meaningful activitiesAll too often childrens disabilities are viewed as entirely biological much like an incurable disease Vygotskys theory emphasizes that the most serious consequence of a physical or mental defect is not the biological impairment itself but the disruption it causes in the childs social relationships You can help your child compensate for his physical limitations through social contact and communication aimed at strengthening the higher thought processesvoluntary attention deliberate memory concept formation logical reasoning problem solving and imagination The mightiness of the mind Vygotsky wrote has virtually no limits When cerebral palsy results in speech hearing or visual impairments promoting language prociency through alternative means is crucial for enhancing development Parents and teachers who maximize childrens communicative capabilities through sign language nger spelling special computer technology and other symbolic innovations grant them access to the minds of others and to tools for collaborating with more capable partners in their zonessure routes to realizing their potential El Abuelo GrandfatherAn oldman figure called el abuelo the grandfather played the role of a bogeyman in Hispano folklore In literature it is sometimes spelled aguelo and some scholars speculate that it may be a borrowed word from the language of the Pueblo Indians In Spanish it means grandfather and has become synonymous with coco cucui and bogeyman This folk character is more known in northern New Mexico than in other parts of the Southwest He appeared at Christmastime to test and discipline children who did not know their catechism or prayers He was a scary figure dressed to terrify children with a black cape and a mask with large horns and always carrying a whip Children were terribly frightened because of his horrid appearance Instead of a mask he sometimes had a tortilla plastered on his face wore buffalo horns and a horsetail and of course carried the whip A few days before Christmas hed knock on the door of a home give a bloodcurdling cry crack his whip and yell at the children Han sido buenos muchachos estos Have these children been good The children would cringe and hide while the parents defended them Then el abuelo would say Pues que recn y se acuestn Well let them pray and go to bed Sometimes he made the children dance Las Palomitas loosely translated as the little doves Espinosa describes this experience After making them pray he makes them form a circle and taking each others hands they dance around the room with him singingBaila paloma de Juan turuntn or durundn sicTurun tn tnTurun tun tnDance dove of Juan confused or disorientedConfused confused A description of el abuelo making children dance the little dove is also available in Steeles work Throughout the year if children misbehaved parents would threaten them Si no te sosiegas llamo el abuelo If you dont behave Ill call the bogeymanEl abuelo is also a prominent figure in the dance of Los Matachines and plays a comical role in which he makes jokes and shouts out instructions to the rest of the dancers In some performances there is a female character la abuela who acts as el abuelos accomplice and plays a similar role Although he is not heard of often in contemporary times references to el abuelo can be found in the folktales and

La Adelita was the name of a woman soldier a soldadera who followed the troops helped to set up camp and cooked for the soldiers Some soldaderas were employed to cook and fulfil the needs of a particular soldier whereas others were relatives or lovers The legend states that Adelita was a woman who fought in the Revolution but it is not known if she actually existed as an individual she came to epitomize all soldaderas and courageous women of that period In popular culture literature and the cinema soldaderas have been portrayed as selfsacrificing women usually mestizas mixedrace women from the lower classes but La Adelita is often seen as a gera lightskinned sweetheart of the troops a woman who is valiant pretty and a wonderful helpmate to the soldier Salas Several corridos ballads have been written about her and she is a powerful symbol for Mexican and Chicana women representing bravery selfdiscipline and romantic love In fact it is primarily through the corridos that Adelita is known today Historically all soldaderas became known as Adelitas In performances by ballet folklrico groups the dances and music of the Revolution are often called Las AdelitasLa Adelita is more than a romantic image to modernday Chicanas She continues to symbolize feminine independence integrity the fight for justice and a proud heritage Because the major influx of Mexican immigration into the United States was during the Mexican Revolution many Chicanos and Chicanas grew up hearing stories about soldaderas and La Adelita from relatives parents and grandparents In the late s Chicanas who joined the Brown Berets de Aztln a political pseudomilitary youth group often dressed as Adelitas wearing rebozos shawls and bandoliers crisscrossed over their chestsOne play about La Adelita titled Soldadera written by Josephine Niggli was produced and performed in the United States in and is still performed today Niggli was years old when the play was written She went on to write Mexican Village a novel that incorporated many of the Mexican peoples folk customs and traditions Born in Monterrey Mexico she lived in Mexico City and was taught at home by her mother Later she moved to San Antonio Texas where she attended high school She went to the University of North Carolina for playwriting sometimes acting in her own plays Soldadera is a play about the women in the Revolution women who left homes to follow their men cooking for them tending their wounds guarding their ammunition fighting when necessary as Niggli put it The Adelita character dies in the play and Niggli idealizes her braveryOne variant of the corrido La Adelita followsEn lo alto de una abrupta cerraniaacampado se encontraba un regimientoy una moza que valiente lo seguialocamente enamorada del sargentoPopular entre la tropa era Adelitala mujer que el sargento idolatrabaporque a mas de ser valiente era bonitay hasta el mismo coronel la respetabaY se oa que deca aquel que tanto la queraY si Adelita fuera mi

Niggli Salas Adivinanzas RiddlesAdivinanzas are riddles Many Chicano children remember being entertained with riddles narrated by parents and grandparents A riddle is an intellectual brainteaser in Spanish called a quebracabeza facts are framed in the form of a question in such a way that the respondent cannot possibly know the answer An example in Spanish is Qu camina de cuatro patas por la maana dos patas en el medio da y tres patas en la noche What walks on four legs in the morning two legs in the afternoon and three legs at night The answer is man who as a child in the morning of life crawls on four legs as an adult walks on two legs and as an old man uses a cane for support thus walking on three legs Another example is a true riddle which is a comparison of something to the unknown answer and that something is described in the question For example Tengo ojos y no miro boca pero no hablo qu soy I have eyes and cannot see a mouth but cannot speak What am I The answer is a photograph Another type of riddle is the conundrum where the answer is contained in the riddle itself such as Agua pasa por mi casa cate de mi corazon Water passes by my house pain of my heart The answer is aguacate avocado Or Lana sube lana baja Wool goes up and wool goes down The answer is la navaja lanabaja the knife Conundrums contain wordplay and in Chicano culture are sometimes bilingual playing with words in both the Spanish and the English language Another type of riddle is the riddling question such as Qu le dijo la luna al sol What did the moon say to the sun The answer is Eres tan grande y no te dejan salir de noche You are so big and yet are not allowed to go out at nightMany Spanish riddles collected in the Southwest reflect in some way the characteristics of the Southwest both linguistically and environmentally Since the problem presented in a riddle is linguistically and culturally based on both the tellers and the audiences culture they must all be members of the same community or group to comprehend the puzzle Bilingual riddles those narrated in both English and Spanish are clearly a Chicano invention growing out of the bicultural experience Riddles are fun and educational as well It is usually children who enjoy telling and listening to riddles Like other folklore genres riddles serve a function helping children learn to interpret facts and form an opinion They use language humor and a verbal fun activity to challenge a childs intellectReferences Brown Campa Espinosa Glazer LuceroWhite McDowell West Adobe Sundried BrickAdobe is a word with Arabic origins that means unburnt bricks made from earth Adobe bricks are made from a mixture of clay and sand sometimes just called mudstraw and are slowly dried by the heat of the sun Various structures homes buildings and churches are built of adobe bricks and then plastered with more adobe mud Buildings made of adobe have lasted for centuries when sufficient and constant care is provided to prevent erosion of the mud Contemporary adobe architecture as found in what is called the Southwest style is a fusion of native New Mexican Indian and Spanish forms The basic structure adobe walls supporting a flat roof is an Indian tradition thousands of years old When the Spanish moved into New Mexico and the Southwest they adopted this basic structure but incorporated their technique of forming the mud into bricks Most of the Catholic missions were built out of adobe Adobe homes and buildings provide a sense of security and protection from outside noise with their twotofourfoot thick walls Often the literature about adobe also mentions the sense of continuity with the earth one feels when living in an adobe homeMaking adobe bricks and adobe hornos outdoor ovens is still a tradition in New Mexico Native American and Hispanic women have a long tradition in the construction of adobe structures The Spaniards noted that it was the Pueblo women who built the adobe walls Within the Hispanic community it has been the role of women known as enjarradoras to plaster the walls of the structures a task that is done with the bare hands A saying in Spanish describes this as El hombre las levanta la mujer las enjarra The man builds the walls and woman plasters them Romero and Larkin In contemporary times the Museum of International Folk Art in Santa Fe sponsors demonstrations of adobe brick making and horno construction performed by women who are wellknown master adoberas makers of adobe and master enjaradorasIn southern Texas and northern Mexico small huts called jacales were also constructed of mudstraw Even though this mud was of almost the same composition it was not called adobe The mud was not formed into bricks and the structures were considered temporary even though many have existed for decadesReferences Boyd Brown Bunting De Leon Graham Romero and Larkin Weigle and White West AgavachadoSee AgringadoAgreda Mara de Jesus Coronel de The Blue LadyA woman dressed in a blue veil or the blue habit of a nun who appeared to help the sick and the afflicted during the seventeenth century Legends of the appearance of the Blue Lady circulated in New Mexico and Texas during the mids There are stories that narrate how she especially liked to help women in need and poor children although it appears her goal was also to Christianize the Indians of the Southwest whom she visited often She was able to speak various Indian languages and would speak to the members of each tribe in their own tongue Fray Damian Manzanet while visiting Texas in reported that the chief of the Tejas Indians spoke of being visited by a beautiful woman dressed in blue garments The chief was requesting blue fabric that his people wanted to use in the burying of their dead There is much written evidence of her appearances in Texas where she was referred to as The Mysterious Woman in Blue The Jumano Indians of Texas were reportedly visited by her approximately times between and The first reference to her is in the memoirs of Fray Alonso de Benavides in Every report we have of her appearances indicates that the Blue Lady was actually Mara de Jesus Coronel de Agreda She was born in Spain in and died May She never physically visited the Southwest but she stated that she made flights to New Mexico to help the Indians Mara de Agredo lived in a convent and wrote several books including one with the title The Mystic City of GodAdina de Zavala cites a San Antonio legend about a mystifying woman in blue who appears once in a generation out of the hidden underground passages of the Alamo bearing a distinctive gift that she bestows on a woman The woman is always a native Texan she may be young old or middleaged but she is always a special woman pure and good well bred intelligent spiritual and patriotic The gift that is bestowed on her is the ability to see to the heart of things and the woman is instructed to use the gift for the good of the

Chicanos who have become very gringolike very anglicized inglesado or americanizado Another word used interchangeably is agavachado meaning too much like a gavacho an Anglo In a bicultural environment or even in tightly knit Mexican communities when individuals become thoroughly acculturated to American society and values the individual may be criticized by close friends and relatives and be called an agringado Agringado is a particularly strong term in comparison to americanizado because the word gringo connotes a strong negative image of a North American All Chicanos are americanizados to a certain extent by learning English and attending public schools But the behavior of an agringado might involve the changing of ones given name so that Carlos becomes Charlie Guillermo becomes Will or Consuelo becomes Connie or changing a surname so that Rivera becomes Rivers or Puentes becomes Bridges In the verbal folklore repertoire of Chicanos jokes abound about Mexicans who become Anglos and adopt the values mannerisms food clothing styles and verbal expressions of the dominant society Besides becoming gringolike a Chicano agringado may overtly reject Mexican American culture the music the values and even the Spanish language by pretending not to speak it Such a person sees the Mexican way of life as inferior to the Anglo and the agringado may marry an Anglo and completely turn hisher back on Chicano culture An agringado will not selfidentify because this kind of behavior is perceived as negative or disloyal to hisher cultural group Rather identifying or pointing out agringado behavior tends to be done by family or peer group members who use teasing joking and narrating exemplary anecdotes characteristic of folkloric behavior This type of behavior is an outcome of living in a bicultural and bilingual environment and serves to strengthen the ingroups sense of cultural identityThe agringado figure has become a stock character in Chicano culture and is frequently encountered in folklore literature and popular culture The film Mi Familia directed and released in by Gregory Nava includes a comical scene depicting the agringado son a UCLA student bringing his

house to house singing carols called aguinaldos and asking for food and gifts Homes were opened to them and they were offered good things to eat and drink In this context aguinaldos are Christmas

songs are mystic in nature many narrate the story of Christs life his anguish betrayal his crucifixion and resurrection and others praise the virtues of suffering and penance Alabados were sung as ritual prayers in homes at dawn noon and at nightfall and they were almost always sung at funeral processions Their melodies are fusions of indigenous music and medieval chants Stories of Mexican California narrate the singing of alabados first thing in the morning by a family each member in hisher own room but all together at the same time Like the dcima tenline poetic song and the romance fourline song alabados were introduced into the New World by the Franciscan padres who taught them to the Indian people as they were teaching them the Bible and converting them to Christianity In recent times alabados have come to mean any religious hymn sung at wakes or religious ceremonies Many are very old and the authors unknown although a few collected in southern Colorado were written by a local singer in the s Folklorists of the s and s were still able to collect some of these ancient hymns from elderly people who learned them from their parents in the nineteenth century Juan Rael published one of the first essays on the alabado in and a recent researcher William Gonzalez of the University of Utah calls them some of the saddest music Ingalls BSee also Los PenitentesReferences

who crosses a wire fence regardless of the means or method In this cultural usage the fence is the wire fence along the MexicanUS border the term is interchangeable with mojado wetback which refers to a person who enters the United States illegally by crossing the Rio Grande in Texas Alambrista is not as common an expression as wetback but it is used frequently by the media The Mexican cinema has produced many films about illegal entry into the United States with many characters playing roles as alambristas An American film with the title Alambrista The Illegal written and directed by Robert Young in deals with the issue of undocumented immigration by portraying the experiences of one mans journey into the United States and back to Mexico It is considered a landmark film because of the authentic portrayal of a life of fear and alienation experienced by the main characterLike the term wetback this is an expression many Chicanos can identify with since many have family members who

for the personal worship by the family Home altars are common in many Mexican and Chicano homes The word altar is derived from the Latin word altare a combination of altus high and ara altar referring to a raised structure for worship one that goes upward toward the sky or heaven It provides a space where religious people can communicate with God the saints or other spiritual beings Home altars vary in size from a small shelf with one votive candle and one saint or statue to a large table altar with many religious images La Virgen de Guadalupe flowers pictures of saints candles a structure that can fill up half a room Permanent altars can be in a small nicho niche in the bedroom the living room or even the dining room Daily devout prayer such as reciting the rosary or praying to a patron or favorite saint is a normal occurrence in many families with the prayers often led by the mother or grandmother A personal home altar may evolve over a period of years rather than being constructed suddenly in one day When the creation is such a gradual process it can reflect and almost chronicle the happy and tragic events that take place in the family As family members are born or die their picture or a favorite personal item of theirs may be placed on the altar along with their patron saint a votive candle or flowers Eventually the altar can become so much a meaningful representation of the family that it will be maintained for years and even generationsThe religious observation of All Souls Day or Da de los Muertos on November is an occasion for many families to erect altars specifically for a parent or other family member who has recently died These altars will traditionally have a picture or pictures of the departed with offerings and gifts Family and friends are invited to visit and add items to the altar which becomes almost a shrine and is called an ofrenda In many US cities Da de los Muertos ritual celebrations have become community affairs that include more than the Chicano community and may entail a procession through the streets ending at a local school or community center In the last thirty or so years the creation and construction of altars have become major art programs for museums schools and community centers in the United States The altars are wonderful artistic creations a form of folk art with local artists participating and involving children in the making of calaveras skeletons papel picado cut tissue paper paper flowers and other decorationsIn Chicano and Mexican culture it is usually women who develop home altars as expressions of devotion to pay homage to past family members and to find a space for daily prayer It is thought that home altars were created as a result of community isolation from a centralized place of worship After Mexico gained its independence from Spain the Spanish friars left Mexico and the Southwest and for many years there werent enough priests to visit all of Mexicos small villages and rural areas Isolated communities and individual families created their own places of worship The wealthy or upper classes were able to build small chapels on their ranches while the poorer classes

public education and created a prosperous Mexican society envied by other communities of the Southwest with elegant theaters like the Teatro Carmen and Spanishlanguage newspapers Tucsons proximity to Mexico especially Sonora permitted Tucsonenses to remain close to their Mexican heritage According to Thomas Sheridan This Mexican elite represented a local florescence of Latin American civilization

barbers and later railroad workers The railroad arrived in southern Arizona on March and this changed society in Tucson foreverThere has always been a substantial Chicano and Mexican population in Tucson The folklore of the region was recognized to be important and Margarite Collier an elementary school teacher organized a Mexican Folklore Club at Carrillo School in Tucson in An article in the Arizona Daily Star of December states that the club was to help the children sustain pride and interest in the traditions customs and folklore of Mexico and to perpetuate these customs among Spanishspeaking people of Tucson Miss Collier taught the children music art and folk dances of Mexico Every year the school organized a Las Posadas procession through the streets of Tucson The same

Chicanos called Aztln was presented at the First National Chicano Youth Liberation Conference held in Denver Colorado in It was articulated in the manifesto El Plan Espiritual de Aztln a document that outlined an ideology meant to unite all Chicanos of the Southwest The document is accredited to Alurista a poet who was already presenting Aztln in a Chicano studies class he taught in at San Diego State University The manifesto stressed the concept of ethnic nationalism and selfdetermination and of the need for Chicanos to control their own communities schools and political structures The

legend found throughout the Southwest south Texas and even parts of northern Mexico that tells of the appearance of the devil at community dances dance halls and discotheques Called the devil at the dance legend or devil haunts the dance hall in folklore literature it is considered to be an urban belief tale that has been adapted to contemporary situations The devil makes his appearance elegantly dressed usually in a suit he is strikingly handsome muy suave smooth and poised tall and refined Consequently he stands out from among the rest of the men Besides his stunning appearance he is always an amazing dancer knows the latest dance steps and selects the prettiest girl to danceAs the tale is often narrated a disobedient young girl goes to the dance without her parents permission or she goes against her mothers express wishes While at the dance a handsome beautifully dressed man asks her to dance They dance all night until she suddenly notices with a shock that he isnt wearing shoes and in fact he doesnt even have feet instead he has chicken feet goats hooves or a pigs foot and a chicken foot It is usually at this point after hes discovered that he disappears into thin air leaving the odor of sulfur in the air or in some versions of the legend just runs out the door The girl he was dancing with either faints or burns to death as she goes up in smoke If the girl doesnt die as in some stories she might suffer a burn on the shoulder or a mans handprint might be found on her back A small circle of people who are present at the dance observe this encounter and the narrator of the story usually says that she or he heard it from someone who was thereThe lesson learned is that one must not disobey ones parents for the handsome man is known to be the devil and the personification of evil It is noted that mostly women narrate these legends among themselves or from mothers to daughters in a didactic fashion to instill fear in young women so that they will not disregard parental authority In some variants a young girl specifically transgresses religious beliefs by insisting on going to a dance on Good Friday a religious holy day and a revered day of prayer

baile is an individual dance step a party or a ball El baile is historically one of the most important social traditions among Mexicans and Chicanos throughout Mexico and the United States Since the Spaniards conquered the Southwest bailes have been important community social and cultural events In Texas New Mexico and California because of the isolation of the communities dancing became the principal source of entertainment The social status of women in Spanish colonial society was limited and cloistered with their primary social venues consisting of church and home El baile provided entertainment and physical activity As an early California traveler put it I was astonished at the endurance of the California women in holding out night after night in dancing of which they never seemed to weary but kept on with an appearance of freshness and elasticity that was as charming as surprising Shay It was at el baile that courtship occurred since girls although they may have gone to the dance chaperoned were allowed to dance with boys it was at el baile that families and relatives interacted that the weeks work was forgotten and that lifes mysteries were discussed The local dance brought the community together and allowed interaction between the sexes A girl was never able to reject a request to dance from a boy because to turn down an invitation exposed the boy to embarrassment and ridicule for his failure in competition and could be cause for revenge Countless corridos ballads leyendas legends and chistes jokes narrate events that are supposed to have occurred at el baile from fights to courtships to elopements Encounters with the legendary weeping woman La Llorona often occur after a dance when a solitary man is finding his way home From the

same meaning as gringo or gavacho Chicanos also often use the term as they do agringado to describe an overly acculturated Chicano one who is trying to be whiteIt is believed the word was originally

writer Although primarily a military man he managed to conduct fieldwork among several Indian tribes and was considered an expert on the Apaches He was stationed along the Rio Grande for two years during the era of the Catarino Garza revolt and his diaries from this period are a valuable resource on the Garza movement He learned the Spanish language apparently because of his ethnological

American Anthropologist Bourke observed chronicled and wrote both as a journalist and anthropologist about the folk medicine practices and the folk foodways of the Rio Grande regionHis approach to folklore study was that of the established tradition of the times which examined current customs traditions folkways and folk narratives as survivals of an earlier civilization Sometimes this survivalist perspective carried with it an attitude about the prior culture where the customs originated as having been a higher civilization Accordingly when Bourke became interested in Mexican customs and language he approached them as the cultural remains of a higher SpanishArabic civilization In spite of the fact that his nineteenthcentury biases are very apparent in his writings the data he collected are valuable for the study of Chicano folklore of the TexasMexican border He was elected president of the American Folklore Society in and he died in He is buried at Arlington National

word bracero comes from the Spanish word brazo arm which is used as English uses hand to mean laborer In the same way bracero commonly means a man who works with his hands a laborer and is used when speaking of all farm and agricultural workers There was a shortage of farm laborers during World War II and this program offered an answer to that problem although some braceros also worked on the railroad Until only recently bracero was applied to any Mexican farmworker and is often used interchangeably with words like wetback or greaser The number of workers brought from Mexico ranged from a low of in to a high of in It is estimated that by nearly braceros had worked in the United States under this program It continued even after the war and between and over braceros were still working in the United States Some have compared the Bracero Program with legalized slavery and the impact on the perception of the Mexican farmworker by American agribusiness has been to foster contempt and disdain Many braceros chose not to return to Mexico when their contracts ended and instead stayed and hid from la migra the feared Immigration and Naturalization Service INSMany Chicanos of the Southwest and Midwest are descendants of braceros who came to the United States and stayed never returning to Mexico The bracero experience has been written about in novels and depicted in numerous movies and although the image presented is often a negative one like other Chicano folk heroes the bracero has become an archetype of the culture He is in the company of the historical mestizo character of Yo soy Joaqun the revolutionary figure of Joaqun Murrieta the mythical pachuco the stately learned persona of Dr Paredes the gentle leadership of Csar Chvez the bracero is the universally exploited farmworker the campesino of the world Many corridos ballads describe the experience of coming to work in the agricultural fields of the Midwest and the Southwest Maria HerreraSobek describes

and witchcraft is common in the Southwest as can be seen by the large number of folk narratives and legends about witches collected in New Mexico and Texas in the last century This form of occultism

in witchcraft Beliefs in witchcraft were prevalent in Europe during the fourteenth fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and the missionary friars brought these beliefs to the New World The Spanish Catholic missionaries worked hard to convert the indigenous populations of New Spain and any nonChristian belief that was not acceptable to the Spanish friars was often attributed to sin evil the

love potions lift spells cure and cause illnesses and in general cause great harm They can also take on any form they desire such as a cat pig or owl and so can make themselves difficult to identify In folktales from New Mexico they often appear as balls of fire flying across the sky Curanderas are sometimes mistaken for witches because of their healing power but they are also often called upon to undo the work of witchesMany of the folktales legends and cuentos stories collected in New Mexico by Aurelio Espinosa Juan Bautista Rael and R D Jameson Robe are about witches and witchcraft In the s writers employed by the Works Progress Administration WPA as part of Roosevelts New Deal collected many cuentos and legends about witches from the people of northern New Mexico and many beliefs expressed then are still held today For instance the way to tell if a person is a witch is to stick two needles in the form of a cross into the sill above a door if the person in the room is a witch she wont be able to leave the room Another belief is that only men named Juan or Juan Bautista or women named Juana have the ability to catch or overpower a witch Conversely the power of a witch cannot be exerted over a person named Juan or Juana A witch cannot sense the presence of a Juan so he may be able to trap her by drawing a circle on the ground and throwing his shirt turned inside out into the circleWitches often take the form of an owl in New Mexican Spanish called a tecolote from the Nahuatl word teolotl The hoot of an owl is an evil omen so one must be careful to stay away from owls In other parts of the Southwest owls are sometimes known as lechuzas A lechuza is a woman who has sold her soul to the devil and becomes an owl by night Only a woman can become a lechuzaA prayer

burrito has come to mean a taco made of a wheat flour tortilla instead of a corn tortilla filled with meat rice frijoles beans and chile then folded and rolled up There are several theories about the origins of the name burrito and there may be some truth to all of them One theory is that when flour tortillas became available in northern Mexico tacos de frijoles or bean burritos were easy to carry in the saddlebags of the vaqueros cowboys so for this reason they came to be called burritos as though they were the sidekicks of the vaqueros horseTacos made from corn tortillas are much older they have been around since the epoch of the Aztecs Wheat and flour were introduced into New Spain by the Spaniards and one can see that the flour tortilla is similar to the flat bread found in many Mediterranean countries Once flour tortillas were discovered the move to making tacos from flour tortillas was logical Since corn tortillas are small and can only bend or fold over once and flour tortillas are more pliable and can be rolled several times the flour taco was a natural outcome A burrito can be made with any type of filling such as beans potatoes chile con carne chile colorado carnitas chile with meat red chile roasted pork meat or even peanut butterFlour tortillas and burritos are found in northern Mexico and the Southwest but are not known in other parts of Mexico Since at least the s Chicanos from Texas have been making what came to be called burritos Originally they were called tacos another story about the origin of the name is that in the s there was an establishment in Jurez Chihuahua Mexico called Los Burritos that sold tacos made of tortillas de harina flour tortillas It became a wellknown place to go and people spoke of going a los burritos to the burritos when they wanted tacos of that kind Commercial burritos became available in San Francisco in according to an article in the San Francisco Chronicle and now there are supposedly over burrito taqueras taco restaurants in the Mission District of that city Burros is the name reserved for the very large tortilla burritos in which the tortilla may be a foot and a half to two feet in diameterSee also TacosReferences Griffith Roemer Cabeza de Baca Fabiola Born in northern New Mexico on May although some sources give her birth date as Fabiola Cabeza de Baca became a famous home economist teacher folklorist and writer She was one of several New Mexican women such as Cleofas M Jaramillo and Nina OteroWarren who wrote of the culture and heritage of their Hispano ancestors Her parents came from longestablished Hispano families who had been in New Mexico for over years Her grandparents raised her from the age of four after her mother died leaving Fabiola with one brother and two sisters She attended the Loretto Academy in Las Vegas and after graduating from high school became a teacher in a rural area six miles from her fathers ranch in La Liendre In she received a BA degree from New Mexico Normal now New Mexico Highlands University and in a BS in home economics from New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts now New Mexico State University In between she also spent one year studying in SpainFor over thirty years she worked as an extension agent teaching the traditional ways of preparing foods and emphasizing the nutritional value in the native diet Two of her books Historic Cookery and The Good Life depict the way of life of the Hispanos in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries In We Fed Them Cactus she presents a biography and ethnography of her family especially her grandmother a strong woman and a curandera and retells the stories narrated to her by her father She depicts the arrival of the Hispano pioneers on the llano plains of western New Mexico in the s and also that of the Anglos in the s the loss of land the fencingin of the plains and the end of the era with the death of her father The title of the book refers to the custom in New Mexico of feeding cattle cactus to keep them alive during droughts In The Good Life not a long book Cabeza de Baca creates a fictional family the Turrietas and uses their story to narrate the rituals customs food and culture of New Mexico The customs of Christmas Lent marriage and a funeral are presented along with many recipes of the foods prepared for these celebrations She wrote many articles for various New Mexican publications In she retired but continued to work giving lectures writing and acting as a consultant to the Peace Corps She died at the age of ninetyseven on October Genaro Padilla refers to her writing as folkloric autobiography a significant genre since it is one of the few kinds of writing by Hispanos that depicts the life they either experienced or learned from their ancestors at the turn of the century Her folkloric work is extremely important because she wrote about women and how their complicated and elaborate daily work so profoundly maintained the culture and traditions of the Hispanos Cabeza de Baca was an active member of many community organizations and was president in of the New Mexico Folklore SocietyReferences Cabeza de Baca Padilla Perrigo Ponce Rebolledo Calavera SkeletonA bony skeleton andor the skull of a skeleton The calavera has become the symbol of the downtrodden who must laugh at life in order to survive it It is also used to mean a drunkard or a very stupid person During the celebrations of the holy day Da de los Muertos candy skulls are made and sold in bakeries throughout Mexico and the United States These skulls may be placed on home altars or given as gifts to children family and friends The Mexican artist and printmaker Jose Guadalupe Posada started drawing calaveras during the late nineteenth century to coincide with this holiday Their popularity is primarily attributed to him and his work His images of calaveras have been reproduced thousands of times and can be found yearround but especially during celebrations of Da de los Muertos Posada printed many calaveras during the period of the presidency of Porfirio Daz and during the Mexican Revolution He introduced the humorous satirical calavera that showed the objectionable side of life that engaged in regular daily activities such as eating dancing drinking fighting enjoying life and being a regular Mexican The Mexican concept of death is exemplified in the satiric antics of the calavera and this perspective is also found in the art literature and performance arts of Chicanos Calaveras are depicted dancing drinking in cantinas bars crowding and falling out of buses and playing instruments in musical groups El Teatro Campesino in its performances always has a calavera character that either represents La Muerte death or typifies a disturbing alter ego of one of the main charactersA Mexican tradition of the late nineteenth century was the publication of a poetic broadside that was called a calavera Published before or during the festivities of Da de los Muertos these calaveras carried poems that poked fun at socially prominent people such as politicians and the very wealthy Some calaveras such as the poems were printed in newspapers but most were small pamphlets or single sheets that were sold on the street For a small fee people could hire a composer to write a calavera for them and draw a skeleton to go with it According to Tinker their main functions are to remind us in a goodhumored way that we all are mortal and to poke fun at friends and attack public officials These last are supposed to take it all in good grace Calaveras are still published every November in many cities of Mexico and in some cities in Texas notably San Antonio Tinker The calavera is now an integral

Spanish colonizers happened much later than in New Mexico and Texas The first Franciscan mission was established in San Diego in years after the exploration of New Mexico A second great difference was that many of the Spanish settlers came by way of Mexico so many of them represented a mestizo mixedrace culture rather than a purely sixteenthcentury Spanish culture as the earlier explorers had Many were Mexican Spaniards and of course did not bring the Spanish language and culture of the Golden Age of Spain with them Their Spanish language and culture had evolved into a slightly New World variantThe population of California did not grow much during the eighteenth century and after the independence of Mexico from Spain in Spanish culture quickly declined in the region Many Spaniards left the region and the great migration of thousands of Anglo American gold seekers took place so the Spanish culture and language could not survive in California as it did in Texas and New Mexico By the Mexican or Californio inhabitants of the state represented percent of the total population At the turn of the century the Chicano population in Los Angeles was only percent It wasnt until with the beginnings of a revolution in Mexico that the first large wave of Mexican immigration was felt in CaliforniaIn discussing Hispano folklore Aurelio M Espinosa the foremost Mexican American folklorist of the early twentieth century delineated three generations of Hispanics in California First were the Mexican Spaniards who settled the region in the eighteenth century and their descendents called Californios who represented the California Spanish traditions that Espinosa most wanted to study Second were the Mexicans who continued to migrate into California during the nineteenth century and these people as Espinosa delicately put it were gente de mas baja condicin y cultura people of a lower condition and culture And third as he wrote his study in the s he found many Spaniards who had recently immigrated to California from Andaluca in Spain and who represented a Spain from a different era and not that of the Spanish Californios As he states he collected romances from the true Californios mostly from the Monterey region In addition he collected folktales proverbs ballads and other lore which were published in the California Folklore Quarterly in the sA renowned proponent of Mexican Spanish folklore in the Southwest and California was Charles F Lummis a selftaught photographer ethnologist musicologist journalist and the founder of the Southwest Museum in Los Angeles Lummis discovered the Mexicans in Colorado New Mexico and California in the s and s and became enamored of the Mexican way of life especially of their hospitality courtesy and respect for age Heisley He collected oral traditions specifically Spanish folk songs from Mexicans in New Mexico and California and felt an urgency to record them before they disappeared The Southwest Museum holds hundreds of songs he recorded on wax cylinders songs in Spanish and in twentyfour Indian languages from southern California He equated Spanish folk songs with the romantic past of the Californios and Mexicans and felt almost a nostalgic fascination for early California history and the era of the large ranchos In his own words The Romance of California is Spanish Romance Everybody knows that who knows anything b Although not a trained folklorist Arnold Rojas writes of the vaquero cowboy culture of California especially in the San Joaquin Valley at the turn of the century and into the first third of the s He describes the life of the Mexican vaqueros how their lives were spent working on large ranches like the Tejon Ranch and the Kern County Land Co Their lives were very narrowly focused on cattle and ranch life and they all spoke mostly Spanish In his reminiscences of vaquero culture and of the impact Mexican Sonorans had on California Rojas shows a side of Chicano culture not commonly known Born in California where his mother and grandmother were also born it is clear he loved the life he lived He writes of La Llorona and Joaqun Murrieta and of Tiburcio Vsquez who once gave food to his grandmother and mother when they were fleeing from the gringos in Los AngelesThere are no overall written accounts or collections of the oral traditions and folklore of the early Californios as we have of the Hispanos of New Mexico In Angustias de la Guerra Ords Occurrences in Hispanic California she describes some customs but her work was not intended to preserve for history the way of life of the Californios Glimpses of customs games dances theater and other traditions can be found in the writings of early western travelers although these were often depicted prejudicially and with a lack of historical context Spanishlanguage newspapers from the late nineteenth century exhibit folk customs and traditions The folklore collected from Mexicans and Mexican Americans in the twentieth century even if its from a third or fourthgeneration Chicano generally will be folklore from Mexico transplanted to California since the turn of the century by immigrants fleeing a revolutionary war or those coming to work in the agriculture fields Of course it could also originate in New Mexico or Texas since there has been much migration into California by Chicanos from those states Folktales jests folk songs corridos ballads and customs related to religious and secular holidays foods and other folk traditions found in contemporary California will have a lot in common with those found in other southwestern states and with Mexico Chicano students have taken an active interest in folklore in the last twenty years and archives established at the University of California at Berkeley and Los Angeles hold growing collections of many genres of Mexican American folklore There are published collections from the s and s of folk medicine rituals and folk narratives collected primarily from

Robe Roeder Rojas Sanchez Cal Spanish SlangCal comes from the gypsy word zincal which is one of the idioms of the Spanish gypsies It is a very old argot influenced by many languages including French English Italian Greek and Hebrew and was spoken by the gypsies of Spain It was brought to New Spain by the Spanish conquistadores where it continued to be identified as the language of the poor the uneducated and also the criminal class Cal became the dialect of the underworld of Mexico City and migrated into the Southwest as some believe through the city of El PasoPublished studies of the speech of the Chicano investigate the diverse communication modes by examining the language that reflects the cultural experiences of the various subcultures of Mexican and Chicano communities Some of these idioms are the pachuco dialect Chicano Spanish New Mexico colonial Spanish south Texas vocabulary cal and the argot of the tirilones of El Paso The pachuco dialect has been especially influenced by cal it was and still is primarily a male speech and if used by women they were considered to be street women or girlfriends of gang members Today however many words from cal are fully integrated into the standard vocabulary of Chicano Spanish and writers incorporate it into poetry short stories and novels What makes cal and its appropriation into Chicano Spanish distinct is its use by workingclass Chicanos and Mexicanos It is a shared language across the MexicanUS border equally used on both sidesThe vocabulary of Chicano Spanish is congested with Old World words words from the pachuco era and consequently heavily influenced by cal Chicanos have a sense of pride in being aware of these words and expressions and knowing how to use them There are many studies that examine the Spanish spoken by Chicanos and several published dictionaries of Chicano Spanish and of cal Most of the studies provide examples of the male use of cal but there is recent research that shows that female cholas and pachucas also have an extensive vocabulary in cal Galindos studies of Chicana prisoners show the social importance of cal in conveying a sense of intimacy and camaraderie between women who shared similar life experiences and acquaintances One published dictionary of cal by Jay Rosensweig presents cal in a rather harsh manner referring to it as gutter Spanish which prompted a reader to take the privilege of writing a comment on the title page of the book This example of book graffiti is presented here because it is an excellent example of the use of Chicano Spanish

people use the betterknown term cementerio meaning cemetery camposanto is a word still used in many families Interestingly some Spanish dictionaries define the word as a cemetery for Catholics whereas they define cementerio as an enclosed place for burying the deadCamposantos are important in Chicano families and the concept of death is always present in personal narratives songs and in the religious holy days observed El Da de los Muertos or All Souls Day is a religious and folk holy day that is devoutly celebrated it usually includes a visit to the cemetery The family cleans the grave sites of loved ones sets up flowers and candles and visits with and prays for the departed During the rest of the year attendance to burial sites does not diminish and graves are kept decorated and colorfulDuring the colonial period of New Spain burials were made within the church itself as was the tradition in medieval Spain Spaniards and the clergy were allowed to be buried in the missionary churches whereas the mestizos people of mixed race and Indians were buried in the camposanto located in front or to the right of the church By the late eighteenth century the Catholic Church forbade additional burials inside churches supposedly for public health reasons but the ricos the welltodo continued to buy their way into the churches So the camposantos were still left for the poor mestizos A recognizable sign of a colonial frontier camposanto was a large public eightfoot wooden cross that stood in the front or center of the cemetery Some can still be found today in rural parts of northern New Mexico and Texas Another feature that can also still be found in parts of the Southwest is segregation and isolation from Anglo cemeteries Many were located side by side but were fenced off and had separate entrances The sites chosen for rural camposantos were often on tierra muerta barren land that was too poor to cultivateCemetery and graveyard decorating traditions have been researched and written about as a means of appreciating and understanding Mexican folk beliefs about death and grieving The adornment of grave sites reflects religious folk practices and ethnic and family attitudes about death and remembrance Some of the customs include decorating and designing a space that will be revisited by a family for many generations The intent is to keep the deceased person alive in the familys memory Some design motifs that are distinctive to Chicano cemeteries are the construction and design of crosses Terry Jordans book has an illustration of twelve different subtypes of wooden Latin crosses found on Mexican graves in Texas In the nineteenth and even into the twentieth century crosses were built of wood but these didnt last long being destroyed either by the elements or by vandalism More common today are crosses made of molded concrete Many grave sites have a cerquito a low wood metal or concrete fence an enclosure that surrounds an individual grave Another common trait is to construct a cement grave marker with a nicho niche built into it so that the statue of a saint La Virgen de Guadalupe or a photograph of the deceased can be placed in it Sometimes a concrete cross will have a nicho built into its base for the same purpose Although fresh flowers are often placed at grave sites paper and plastic flowers are more common Colorful plastic wreaths are sometimes attached to the wooden or cement cross Another distinguishing feature in Chicano camposantos is the wide range of materials used in decorating a grave As with home yard shrines and home altars everyday objects are used as personal and artistic statements It is often in the performance of highly charged personal rituals that people create folklore folk art and folk musicMany grave markers are brightly painted and some even have religious scenes painted on them This tradition has been linked to Mexicos indigenous heritage for as Terry Jordan states Such use of color in a sacred context has ample preColumbian precedent in Mexico where even the huge pyramids once bore bright paints He goes on to say Hispanic graveyards are places of color where paints flowers and tiles combine to comfort the bereaved and startle the gringo See also Altars Folk Art NichosReferences Barber Gosnell and Gott Griffith Jordan Sanborn Legends See LeyendasLa Leyenda Negra The Black LegendLa Leyenda Negra is the term used for a myth that describes a very negative attitude many believe pervades the historical perspective regarding Hispanics and Mexicans The Black Legend embodies a belief that Spaniards are basically a cruel evil lazy greedy treacherous and fanatical people It originated in the era of Inquisitorial Spain and has misrepresented the history of Spain since the s The printed history of the conquest of the New World depicts a violent and corrupt invasion but there is a belief that the Black Legend has influenced the way this history has been writtenThe Black Legend originated in the sixteenth century during the Protestant Reformation with the beginnings of a rejection of Catholicism and abhorrence of the political and military power of Spain When Spain and Portugal remained loyal to Catholicism and expanded their empires by settling in South America Central America the Caribbean Islands and parts of North America the rest of Europe looked on very disapprovingly This viewpoint has continued to color everything about Spain since then including the grim legacy left by Spain in the New World It has justified the dictatorial treatment of Latin America and Mexico by the United States since the early nineteenth century Biased attitudes toward Catholic Spain were inherited by Anglo Americans and brought to the New World colonies by Protestant English settlersThe term Leyenda Negra was assigned to this belief by Julian Juderias a Spanish intellectual in He stated that antiSpanish propaganda and misconceptions had continued to develop since the sixteenth century and historical distortions in both Europe and America constituted a Leyenda Negra It is thought that the Black Legend is actually the basis for the discriminatory treatment of Mexicans by Anglo Americans during the conquest of the frontier in the s and even for the current treatment of Chicanos in the United States in the twentieth century The cause for derogatory stereotyping of Mexicans and other Latin Americans is difficult to understand and the negative stereotype seems to have no historical basis until one understands the history of the Black Legend Publications by early American travelers to the Southwest and Mexico depict the Spanish Mexicans in not only horrendous terms but with extreme passion Thomas Jefferson Farnham a New England attorney wrote in the s In a word the Californians are an imbecile pusillanimous race of men and unfit to control the destinies of that beautiful country Weber Stephen Austin in after a trip to Mexico City wrote To be candid the majority of the people of the whole nation as far as I have seen them want nothing but tails to be more brutes than the apes Weber During the USMexican war of the uncivil treatment of Mexicans and Californios and the public conviction in the righteousness of the war are cited as examples of how Mexico was disrespected by Americans Historically powerful stereotypes of inferior Mexicans and Mexican Americans perpetuated by arrogant Americans such as Austin led to the acceptance of Manifest Destiny as Americas right The result of such efforts to discredit Mexico and justify war was a widespread belief that the Godforsaken Mexicans were unworthy to keep the valuable resources and land they had inherited from Spain Sanchez The popular image of a Mexican with a large sombrero sleeping under a cactus very likely originated from these early writings of traveling Americans with the result that the icon has become imprinted forever upon the collective character of Chicanos and Mexicans The common reference to finally the sleeping giant awakens when conferring on Mexican American socialpolitical issues is made often by educated and acculturated Chicanos manifesting an internalization of an image imposed from outside the Mexican culture Although no one actually mentions the Black Legend belief its legacy permeates a lot of Chicano oral folkloreReferences Powell Sanchez Weber Leyendas LegendsA leyenda a legend is an oral narrative different from a folktale in that it is narrated as if the event described occurred in the recent past and the story is believed by the narrator to be true There is often a supernatural element to the narrative such as a persons disappearance into thin air yet it will be recited as having occurred in a specified locale Often the narrator states where the story originated and explains that the events were observed by a grandmother cousin father or friend The names of persons and places in the narrative will be familiar to the audience In Chicano oral tradition stories about La Llorona the Blue Lady or Joaqun Murrieta can properly be called legends and almost always tell a story the audience wants to believe The Chicano communitys cultural belief system is inherent in the narrative otherwise the legend would not be recited and retold again and again There are hundreds of variants of the La Llorona legend all narrated about known encounters with her during the past years Her tragic story is believable and one can say she is probably the quintessential legendary figure of the Chicano folk belief systemThe urban belief tale sometimes just called an urban legend is a subtype of the legend and is called such because it circulates among all classes and ages and reflects modern stresses and anxieties It is not only found in urban centers but in rural regions as well In addition to the legend of La Llorona Weeping Woman another widespread legend in Chicano folklore is the Vanishing Hitchhiker although not always known by this name A California folklore journal first carried an article about it in and a Chicano version appears in Millers narrative collection from Los Angeles with a date of The story usually involves a driver who picks up a hitchhiker often late at night and often a young girl and he drops her off at or near her home She leaves something in his car or he lends her a jacket or sweater and the next day he returns to retrieve it and learns that she was a ghost and has been dead for several years Sometimes she is met at a dance and asks a boy to drive her home or she might be a nun but the ghost is rarely a male Brunvand calls it a classic automobile legend and its prevalence has increased since cars became affordable to all social classes Interestingly the Vanishing Hitchhiker legend is one of the few narratives shared by both Anglo American and Chicano folklore Mark Glazer discusses a collection of variants from the Rio Grande Folklore Archive at Pan American University in Texas and states that the legend is part of a culture which believes in miracles mystery and romance See also Agreda Mara de Jesus Coronel de La Llorona Murrieta JoaqunReferences Brunvand Glazer b Miller Robe Limpia CleansingA folk medicine ritual also called a barrida from the Spanish verb barrer meaning a sweeping as in housecleaning Limpiar means to clean and a limpia is similar to a barrida Both words mean a cleansing in a medical and in a spiritual sense Some people use the word limpieza instead of limpia but the significance is the same An individual may seek a limpia from a healer if the person is not feeling well with no specific cause or feels that bad luck or misfortune is prevalent in his or her life A limpieza can expel the hostile forces and also provide spiritual strength so that the person can effectively fight off negative energy Spiritual healers who are not curanderos perform limpias although mostly it is curanderos who perform this ritual The patient may be standing sitting in a chair or lying down while the ritual is performed The healer will sweep the patient with a little broom made of herbs such as sage rosemary and rue believed to be effective in eliminating evil influences Herbal water holy water or alcohol is sprinkled over the person in the form of a cross and the healers hands are used to sweep along the whole body pushing away the evil spirits While this is being done prayers are recited The prayers may be the Lords Prayer or Las Doce Verdades del Mundo The Twelve Truths of the World Instead of herbs some curanderos use an object for the sweeping such as an egg or a lemon believing that it will absorb the harm or illness affecting the patient These objects are burned after the ritual ensuring the recovery of the person The person is swept on all sides front and back and if there is pain in a particular spot special attention will be given to that area Trotter states that the presence of the curandero the soothing effect of the sweepings touching and the lowkey monotone chant of the prayers produces in the patient a light trance state that is comforting and reassuring Trotter and Chavira See also Curanderismo Las Doce VerdadesReferences Roeder Trotter and Chavira La Llorona The Weeping WomanThis is the name of probably the most famous legendary woman found in Greater Mexico The ancient legend of La Llorona has been traced to preColumbian times in Mexico and there is continuing discussion whether it may also have medieval European origins Most Chicanos heard of her as children read about her in literature or learned of her from friends La Llorona meaning the weeping woman or the howling woman may be represented as an Indian woman an ugly old witch or a beautiful woman in white with long flowing hair She always appears late at night and her crying and weeping can be vividly heard as she shrieks Ayyy mis hijos Oh my childrenAccording to the tragic legend there once was a woman who was abandoned by her husband or lover and left with two or three children Angry and seeking revenge she kills her children by throwing them into a river or sometimes by other means When she realizes what shes done she goes insane She is condemned to spend eternity searching for her lost and dead children Consequently she is often heard in the night calling her children She frequents rivers and other bodies of water and is sometimes seen floating above the water looking searching for her children Her legend has been recited for over years and in contemporary times she is still believed to be wandering the streets in large cities as well as in the small towns of the Southwest where numerous people report encounters with her At times she is seen as a beautiful woman wearing a white dress roaming back streets and country roads crying and weeping Sometimes she becomes visible to the wayward husband who is out late drinking and when he approaches her she turns into an ugly horsefaced hag scaring him into swearing abstinence forever Parents use her name to scare little children into obedience Hay viene La Llorona portat bien The Llorona is coming behave yourself Even adults whove heard the story many times and do not want to admit belief still fear a latenight encounter with La LloronaThere are ancient texts of indigenous mythology narrated by the Aztecs and recorded by the Spaniards that very closely resemble the La Llorona legend In some tales she is believed to be Cihuacoatl the patron goddess of women who die in childbirth It is said that Cihuacoatl carried a little baby cradle on her back or a dead baby in her arms as she roamed the country crying through the nights Those who saw her considered it an ill omen Sahagn mentions in The Conquest of Mexico that a woman was often heard as she went weeping and crying out Loudly did she call out at night She walked about saying O my beloved sons now we are about to go Horcasitas and Butterworth Horcasitas and Butterworth reprint several texts of these early chronicles Diego Muoz Camargo ca also reported that before the Spaniards arrived many times and many nights was heard the voice of a woman who cried out in a loud voice drowning herself with her tears and with great sobs and sighs wailing Horcasitas and Butterworth Contemporary texts of La Llorona collected in Mexico assert that the original Llorona was La Malinche the mistress of Corts Corts abandoned her to return to Spain and according to the legend Malinche killed their son with a knife This could be the source of another characteristic of the La Llorona legend In many variants the reason for her abandonment by her lover is their class differences He leaves her for someone of his own class or she is an Indian woman or a mestiza mixedrace woman and he is of pure blood In other variants she is a woman of the streets who doesnt want her illegitimate children so she throws them into the river She is always described as having long hair down below her waist and is seen wearing a white gown Sometimes men see her as a temptress and a siren she entices them to follow her and then she frightens them with her horrible looks They are usually found dead the next day What appears to be an unjust punishment is that La Llorona is condemned to wander for eternity crying and repenting searching for her lost children All mothers who have lost children identify with her and feel her painThe prodigious amount of published literature about La Llorona by folklorists literary critics anthropologists and feminist writers attests to the complexity of the legend Childrens books short stories novels and films have been created based on this basic story of infanticide and repentance We find narratives in rural and urban areas of the Southwest on college campuses in juvenile halls in large cities of the Midwest such as Chicago and among the native populations of MexicoMany Chicanos see themselves as orphans of La Llorona as the lost children of the marriage between the Aztecs and the Spanish Conquerors She is a beloved female archetype among contemporary Chicanas who write poems short stories and academic research articles about her As one writer put it It is finally time to let go of a single narrow understanding of the tale and to see La Llorona instead as an always evolving emblem of gender sexuality and powerand too as another female victim of historys tender mercies Candelaria See also Leyendas La Malinche La MuerteReferences Anaya Arora

various methodsmeans that it sits very close to the ground and has a sleek streamlined appearance The driver andor owner is called a low rider and the act of low riding refers to all the activities associated with driving the car cruising caravanning and hopping Low riders have commonly been associated with cholos s urban youth and gangs but traditionally Chicanos seriously involved in low riding and customizing lowrider cars are not involved in gangs and lowrider clubs actually present an alternative to gang involvement Lowrider car clubs communicate a message of cultural pride and unity Although different the cholo subculture can be closely linked to the lowrider subcultureIt is not clear when low riding started but it was already a custom by the s in Los Angeles and Sacramento although the name low rider did not come into usage until the s After World War II because of the growth in the economy many Chicanos could afford to buy cars old and new and the practice of customizing cars and cruising became very popular throughout the Southwest and California during the s The most popular cars to lower are long ones such as Fords Buicks and Chevrolets Hydraulic lifts are used to lower and raise both the front and rear ends of a car Before it was discovered that a hydraulic lift could be used with the batteries stored in the trunk of the car different methods were used to lower the chassis of the car Early crude methods were to place heavy bricks and cement bags in the trunk or to cut the springs coils or lower the cars blocks To give the car that lowered look the top might be cut back to lower the roof In recent times once a car is lifted or all juiced up the driver controls the lift with a hand controlThe painting and decorating of the exterior and interior of the car are very important for appearances personal identity and also for belonging to a car club and participating in car shows The interior may be upholstered in crushed velvet red or black have walltowall carpeting a bar a chandelier a TV and a stereo tape deck The exterior may be painted in two tones a lacquer mixed with iridescent flakes or have a pearl finish Sometimes the undercarriage is chromed and goldplated Painting lowrider cars is a specialty only available at certain paint and body shops so low riders must be aware of such businesses Besides the painting of the car other decorative designs or motifs may also be applied such as pinstriping fancy lace a fire design and murals Murals of an Aztec or Mayan scene or La Virgen de Guadalupe are popular icons painted on the trunk hood or roof of the car Even though there is similarity in the styles each car is very different in the final production There are many techniques employed to arrive at a unique personal style For instance accessories from differentyear models are interchanged such as side panels from a model may be cut and welded to a car or Cadillac tail lamps on a Chevy Impala Bright Low riders are usually young urban Chicanos between the ages of eighteen and thirty and there can be two and three generations of low riders in one family The cost of fixing and maintaining a lowrider car is fairly high so the owner typically is a working person Since finding older cars say from the s is becoming difficult some low riders now customize small trucks motorcycles and bicycles as well The movie Mi Vida Loca My Crazy Life depicts the work that goes into customizing a pickup truckCruising involves driving very slowly up and down city streets such as Mission Street in San Francisco Whittier Boulevard in Los Angeles and King and Story Roads in San Jose California The objective of cruising is to socialize to see and be seen to give others the opportunity to admire ones car and to admire the other cars consequently the driving must be very slow muy despacito Driving a great customized car beautifully painted is a unique experience for the low rider Cruising slowly and smoothly sitting low in the drivers seat glancing out at the street nodding the head slightly when being recognized all these make up an experience only a Chicano low rider who has invested lots of time and money in his car can appreciate Cruising is often compared to the custom of promenading around a plaza referred to as el paseo in many Latin American and Mexican cities In this sense the lowrider car becomes a cultural vehicle as represented by the artist Gilbert Lujan in his series titled Cultural VehiclesA lowrider Ford LTD called Daves Dream is on display at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington DC the first and only lowrider car in the museum From Chimayo New Mexico Dennis Martinez Richard Martinez and David Jaramillo worked on customizing the car starting in It has two hydraulic pumps with the batteries stored in the truck that lift and lower the car and can make it rock from side to side and give it an appearance of dancing Actually car dancing is an event held at lowrider car showsWithin the lowrider subculture there exist several divisions of traditions For instance car clubs are an important aspect of the culture and a way to showcase cars in competitions One of the oldest ongoing car clubs in Los Angeles is named the Dukes Members of car clubs are referred to as clubbers and they compete for trophies ride in car caravans and often participate in fundraising events Cholos are considered another group less financially stable with more modern cars less ornate and likely more Mexicano in orientation A third group the cha chas are Mexican immigrants who drive the Toyotas and Volkswagens and are a smaller groupLow Rider Magazine was founded during the s to provide a forum for low riders and the culture that surrounds low riding Low Rider has been very instrumental in the widespread growth of lowrider car clubs and Low Rider Happenings throughout the Southwest Low riding is looked upon as a very Chicano cultural phenomenon yet it has spread to other ethnic communities There are many nonChicano car clubs and the Japanese have also adopted it Low Rider has been publishing a Japanese edition for the past four years and has

them dates back to the Roman history of Spain These small fires are built in New Mexico to celebrate La Noche Buena Christmas Eve and to light the way for the announcement of the birth of the Christ child One family may light three luminarias in front of their home one each for Jesus Mary and Joseph while another may light twelve one for each of the twelve apostles It is believed luminarias originate from the huge bonfires built in preChristian times to celebrate rituals to the gods and goddesses Also in ancient times shepherds built fires to keep themselves warm and to scare off the wolves This tradition continued in New Mexico with the shepherds fires to illuminate the way for the coming of Jesus Christ They are not as well known as farolitos in contemporary American popular

MachismoMachismo describes a stereotypic image of a ChicanoLatino man who is extraordinarily aggressive stresses dominance over his wife and family exhibits physical and sexual prowess and places strong emphasis on masculine rigidity Chicano social scientists have authored studies about machismo noting that it is a stereotype often used against Chicanos to blame them for their underclass social position in American society Macho literally means male and machismo is the concept of maleness but in American culture it has come to mean an exaggerated masculinity A masculinity associated with violence selfcenteredness chauvinism or alcoholism is not a macho concept recognized by most Chicanos For Chicanos un hombre macho is a man who symbolizes dignity takes care of his family has respect for all women especially his mother and possesses a strong sense of selfidentity and character Many Chicanos grew up influenced by Mexican movies with characters like Pedro Infante Cantinflas Antonio Aguilar and Jorge Negrete as men who sang to the beautiful girls and defended the poor by fighting for justice and social equality These were positive images of machosThe famous Mexican folklorist Vicente Mendoza has stated that the concept of machismo and the word macho were not prevalent in Mexican corridos ballads and popular culture until the s Supposedly the word gained popularity after Avila Camacho became president of Mexico because in ballads macho easily rhymed with CamachoIn an article published in Jos Armas describes machismo as a mode of behavior necessary for an individual to live life with integrity selfreliance and dignity He states Machismo is a personal code of honor that is self imposed in a world devoid of universal moral law or justice It is maintained and sustained by individual pride and dignity A Latino mens group calling themselves Hombres Latinos was formed in California with the purpose of redefining the image and concept of machismo This was reported in a Los Angeles Times article in written by Christopher Heredia The group is organized on the the compadrazco system meeting regularly and holding yearly retreatsTheir definition of the Macho is He who is dignified He who is a protector He who is responsible He who is nurturing He who is spiritual He who is faithful He who is respectful He who is friendly He who is caring He who is sensitive He who is trustful He who providesTello ca For some Chicanos machismo is an emblem that symbolizes resistance to social and historical control Excessive masculinity is seen by some as adaptive behavior in situations where Chicano men feel racial oppression and discrimination The idea of exaggerated masculinity has crept into American popular culture and language so most Americans have an idea of the meaning of machismo and we find it regularly used by the media For instance the Marlboro Man is viewed as a macho man strong and independent as he rides his horse herding cattle This was a model that many young men grew up trying to emulate but this symbol is no longer acceptable to modern American societySee also PintosReferences Andrade Armas Baca Zinn Castillo

illness believed to be transmitted by certain individuals witches some think who have a special power Mal ojo may be transferred by a peculiar person who gazes at a weaker person a woman or a child and the ill effects are felt immediately Socially it can indicate that a person has been more familiar with another person than social and cultural manners permit The glance or power of a stronger person causes an adverse consequence on the weaker person who is often a baby or a child The fear of mal ojo also indicates that mothers and other adults are distrusting of a person who acts in a more familiar way than is culturally appropriate It is thought that people with weak blood sangre liviana are more susceptible to receiving mal ojo The symptoms of mal ojo are vomiting diarrhea loss of weight and sometimes even death Witches can deliberately give someone the evil eye other times it is done unintentionally by persons who just happen to have a powerful gleam A person may give another the evil eye because of a feeling of jealousy or covetousness If a person covets or is envious of a child he or she may give that child the evil eye Preventive measures that may diminish the possibility of a child getting mal ojo are to touch the childs cheek or make the sign of the cross on the childs forehead Sometimes the evil eye may be undone and the illness avoided if the person who cast the glance pats the persons head or temples immediately relieving him or her of the curse If the illness is induced by a witch another type of remedy must be soughtBelief in the evil eye or that someone can harm another by looking at him or her in a certain way is found all over the world It has been documented in Mediterranean countries eastern Europe North Africa Central America Mexico and

sweep with an egg sweep the ill person with an uncooked unbroken egg The egg is swept over the body of the person without touching them while prayers are recited such as the Hail Mary and the Our Father The egg serves to extract the fever from the ill person and is then broken into a bowl of water and placed under the bed of the person During the night the egg is believed to still be extracting fever from the patient and in the morning if the egg is found to be cooked it is a sign that the patient had mal ojo The egg is then thrown over the shoulder of the mother in the direction

when he landed in Mexico She spoke both Nahuatl and Maya among other Indian languages and quickly learned Spanish becoming Cortss translator and also his mistress Upon learning her name Corts had her christened as Doa Marina and she became known to everyone by that name although her Aztec name was Malintzin which possibly the Spaniards pronounced Malinche so she was also called by this name She bore one son by Corts During the whole Spanish Conquest period she spoke for the Indians to Corts and translated Montezumas dialogue to him According to Mexican and Chicano folklore she metaphorically represents the raped Indian woman that produced the mestizo mixed Spanish and Indian race the Mexican but she is also considered a doublecrosser She informed Corts about a planned ambush at Cholula which saved his life and caused the massacre of thousands of Indians She became known as La Lengua meaning the tongue because of her work as a translator for Corts Del Castillo believes that Doa Marina was following her religious faith and belief in a godly force the prophecies of Quetzalcoatl and did not think she was betraying her people Corts is supposed to have stated After God we owe this conquest of New Spain to Doa Marina Because she gave birth to the first mestizo the first Mexicano she is considered the mother of la raza csmica the cosmic raceIn Chicano culture a person who turns his back on his people is call a malinchero or if its a woman who has betrayed her community a malinche Contemporary Chicanas have taken La Malinche as a positive role model to illustrate and explain the survivalist psyche of the Chicana in modern society Her influence in the conquest of Mexico may be debatable but there is no doubt that she is considered a heroine almost on the same plane as La Virgen de Guadalupe Octavio Paz writes of La Malinche as the violated woman La Chingada and his writings have influenced several generations of Mexicanos and Chicanos in seeing the Mexican people as hijos de la chingada that is sons of a conquest by rapeCorts married Doa Marina off to one of his lieutenants Juan Jaramillo and they had one daughter She went with them to Central America and there died of an illness when she was approximately twentythree years of age Some scholars regard La Malinche as the archetype of La Llorona and others think of her as the original Llorona weeping woman while some consider her to be the source of La Llorona legendTo many Chicanas Malinche has become a symbol for the socioeconomic and educational limitations of contemporary life They feel the defamation of her character is equal to the denigration of Chicanas The victimization and criminalization of Malinche a double oppression is parallel to the experiences of young Chicanas and Mexicanas Malinche and La Virgen de Guadalupe are two archetypes of womanhood in Mexico and in the Southwest the whore and the virgin who symbolize the precarious dilemma of being female Malinche has played an enormous role in the literary production of Chicana writing in essays and short stories but especially in poetrySee also La LloronaReferences Alarcon Candelaria Del Castillo Glantz Harris Paz

phrase mandar hacer means to have made or to command to be made In folk religious practices a manda is interpreted as a promise or contract made with a saint the Virgin Mary or God The contract is not a legal commitment nor made with the approval of a priest or the Catholic Church It is purely a personal promise made to fulfill or complete a journey a devotional act or to recite a certain number of prayers This promise is in exchange for the curing of an illness or for a solution to a problem The manda may involve the placing of a milagro symbol of a miracle at the shrine of a saint La Virgen de Guadalupe cathedral in Mexico City for example or the lighting of candles at the local church Although the fulfillment of the manda in itself may not be difficult its completion often involves some sacrifice and this aspect is also considered part of the manda Lighting daily candles could be a financial strain and a pilgrimage may take several years to complete yet neither is ever forgotten and a manda is taken more seriously than a legal written contract There may be fear of retribution from a saint if the manda is not fulfilled and sometimes individuals actually suffer this retribution If a woman makes a manda asking for a cure to her childs illness and the child is cured but she does not complete the manda the child may become ill again The woman will believe the second illness was caused because she did not complete her manda A manda may be completed after the request is fulfilled in thanksgiving or it may be fulfilled before the petition is answered with the assumption that it will be answered Mandas are very private and often only very close family members are aware that a person has made oneReferences Cant a Durand and Massey Egan Oktavec La Mano Negra The Black HandIn

musical group has become a national symbol of Mexico and of most Mexicanos living in Greater Mexico They are contracted to play at traditional ritual celebrations such as baptisms weddings quinceaeras fifteenth birthday parties fiestas patrias patriotic festivals most festivals and sometimes funeralsA traditional Mariachi group can consist of anywhere between five and thirteen musicians The uniqueness of the group is that it is composed of brass and string instruments only trumpets violins and guitars Some groups may also include a harp a guitarrn bass guitar or a string bass Mariachis have traditionally been male musicians but since the s female musicians have been accepted into many groups and there are now complete groups composed of only femalesThe attire of the Mariachis is a charro horseman suit that incorporates elements of the Spaniards dress of the eighteenth century boots tightfitting pants short waistlength jackets all embroidered with braid or silver ornaments White shirts with ribbon ties made into bows and the traditional widebrimmed sombrero complete the ensemble Some outfits are all white black dark blue or even red and can be very striking when twelve or more musicians all standing start playing a typical Mexican song such as La Negra or Las Maanitas According to NajeraRamirez the early Mariachi groups dressed like peons with white muslin shirt and pants It was not until that they started wearing charro costumes following the example established by Miguel Lerdo de Tejada and his orquesta tpica the national folkloric orchestra By the s the charro costume became an institutionalized part of the Mariachi tradition when the government required Mariachis performing for official functions to wear charro outfits Mariachi groups have been very popular in southern California since the s and currently hundreds of groups have been formed in the Los Angeles area Even students at the University of California at Los Angeles formed a group in called Mariachi Uclatln One famous group from Los Angeles is Los Camperos de Nati Cano The Horsemen of Nati Cano organized in who perform at their restaurant La Fonda owned by Nati Cano This Mariachi

popular throughout the Southwest They have been held in San Antonio Texas Tucson Arizona San Jose California and even Universal Studios in Hollywood originated a festival in Los Angeles is home to the largest assemblage of Mariachi musicians in the United StatesTheories about the origin of the word Mariachi are interesting There is the idea that it evolved from Mara the name of the mother of Jesus Christ Another idea is that it comes from the French word for marriage But it is likely that the etymology of the word is of an indigenous nature Mariachi groups originated in the region of Jalisco even before it was named as a state a region greatly influenced by the Coca people and in fact the Nahuatl word for contemporary indigenous performers is mariachitosReferences Harpole Loza

dance is performed by the Pueblo Indians in honor of the Madonna The dance is also performed in Mexico Texas and Arizona during other holidays and saints days Controversy over the origin of this ritual dancedrama has not been resolved and the literature and research produced keep growing It is based on a medieval Spanish mystery play but in the New World version influenced by Aztec culture and customs it portrays the betrayal of Montezuma by the Spaniards and the acceptance of Christianity by Montezuma Its Iberian origins lie in the conflict between the Christians and Moors The Danza de los Matachines is probably the only ritual dance that is danced by both Hispanic and Native American communities in New MexicoThe word matachines can translate to mean clowning or trickery but can also mean puppet player jester and buffoon Matachines refers to the men who dance as a group the group is composed usually of twelve men but can have from ten to fourteen In sixteenthcentury Europe a matachin was a masked dancer an entertainer who danced with a sword It is likely that the Moors transplanted the dance to Europe and that matachin may come from the Arabic word mutawajjihin meaning to assume a mask There are many eighteenth and nineteenthcentury literary references to a matachine sword dance indicating that such a dance was performed in EuropeSimilar to the dancedrama of Los Moros y Cristianos the dance of Los Matachines was taught to the subjugated Indians by the Spanish missionaries as a custom to celebrate on Christian feast days but also as a means of converting them to Catholicism Flavia Waters Champes interpretation is that the dance was brought to New Mexico by Spanish and Mexican settlers who came with De Vargas at the time of the second conquest in In New Mexico the dance group is open only to men and it is considered an honor to be a part of it The masked men with decorated headdresses dance in two parallel rows in bright costumes decorated with long ribbons that appear to be a combination of Aztec and southwest Indian in origin The main characters in the drama are El Monarca the King who represents Montezuma and four Capitanes The swords referred to earlier have become threepronged palmas palms in the New World In the performances of some groups there is a queen La Reina but in others she might be called La Malinche the Indian woman who became the mistress of Corts who represents innocence or the Church La Reina is often a little girl dressed in a white dress In some locations it is believed the dancers represent the Twelve Apostles but in others they are just ordinary men They carry an image of the Madonna and move along in a candlelit procession One and sometimes two prominent performers are El Abuelo the grandfather and La Abuela the grandmother who act as leaders and also as clowns throughout the dance El Abuelo wears a rubber mask and is dressed somewhat like a white man sometimes carrying a whip and directing the rest of the dancers He calls out songs and dance instructions and cracks his whip against the ground Another dancer sometimes a small boy will represent El Toro the bull who initiates a bullfight with El Abuelo and is slain This side battle symbolizes the battle between good and evil The music is usually played with nonindigenous instruments like the violin and guitar The costumes and masks of the dance are very important and are usually made by the dancers themselves or their familiesIn some towns Los Matachines perform their dance on Christmas New Years Day or the towns patron saints day There is documentation of the Matachines dance performed during church fiestas and funerals by the Tarahumara Indians of northern Mexico In Laredo Texas the Matachines from the Ladrillera barrio venerate the Holy Cross and La Virgen de Guadalupe as their patron saint In this instance the tradition here is closely related to the Yaqui and Mayo matachinesInterestingly both Native Americans in the United States and Mexicans in Mexico are still performing a dance introduced into the New World over years ago This tradition performed today in the United States reinforces a heritage with roots in the culture from the eighth century Because Indians Mexicans and mestizos mixedrace people perform it the dance has evolved with different interpretations and has different meanings for each group The

completely culturally defined until after the Mexican Revolution in the late s The concept had to do with Mexican nationalism and a sense of selfidentity with a Mexican consciousness The term conceptualized a new identity and an awareness of Mexicanness that was native drawing on the indigenous and the mestizaje mixedrace nature of the country It was in the s when the term lo Mexicano became more known in association with nationalism and could be seen in the life of Mexico and in the art and literature produced after the Revolution Even in the United States the art of Mexican painters such as Diego Rivera and Jos Clemente Orozco was admired and well received because of its Mexican character The writings and research of the Mexican philosopher Samuel Ramos brought attention to the national character of the Mexicano and to a definition of Mexican identity Lo Mexicano referred to the Mexicanidad the national character of the Mexican which was mestizo mixedrace and not EuropeanThis essence called lo Mexicano can be found in art literature music and folklore for it encompasses the whole experience of being culturally Mexican The lore of Mexicanidad has migrated to

MiraclesA milagro is literally a miracle but in folk religious practices milagros are tiny objects presented to a saint at a shrine or church as a token or offering intended to fulfill a vow made to that saint Sometimes these objects are called exvotos meaning from a vow and are in the shape of the object that symbolizes what the vow was about For example the milagro could be in the shape of an arm heart leg or baby In Mexico and the Southwest such vows may be called promesas or mandas and can be fulfilled by prayers pilgrimages and promised visits to a saints shrine if the wish or favor is granted This is an important folk religious tradition common among Latinos and Chicanos in the Southwest Mexico and throughout Latin America A mother may make a promesa to La Virgen de Guadalupe to visit her shrine in Guadalajara if her daughter is cured of breast cancer When the promesa is fulfilled this mother may leave a tiny silver breast a milagro to symbolize the realization of the promesaMilagros are made out of wood wax or bone but the most common material is silver or a silverlike metal and they are usually very tiny objects about one inch in diameter The custom of offerings to saints goes back hundreds of years and can be traced to the Mediterranean among preChristian Greeks Romans and Iberians The tradition as it has evolved in the New World is an amalgamation of African Native American and Spanish beliefs Saints are very important among Chicano Catholics influencing every aspect of daily life and acting as mediators between man and God Promesas made to saints and the milagros presented are a reflection of their strong predominance in daily life In the Southwest this custom has been documented since the colonial period and was undoubtedly introduced by the Spanish missionariesIt is known that Hernn Corts the conqueror of Mexico had a milagro made in the shape of a gold scorpion which he offered to the patroness of his home Our Lady of Guadalupe in Guadalupe Spain This was in thanks for surviving the bite of a scorpion that he received in Yautepec Mexico in In the past most milagros were commissioned and the local silversmith made them out of

Oktavec Toor Mojado WetbackA translation of the word wetback sometimes spelled mojao which literally simply means wet It is a pejorative expression although it is sometimes used by Mexican people to describe themselves and their experience of illegally crossing the Rio Grande to come to the United States Also it is a designation used against all Chicanos with the same prejudicial meaning as greaser or spic Some Chicanos use the term to refer to recent Mexican immigrants and also to differentiate themselves from undocumented immigrants Among teenage Chicanos the word mojado is translated to English and illegal Mexicans are often just called wetsDescriptions of the wetback experience have been chronicled and narrated in corridos ballads and novels In Mexico the term sometimes used is espaldas mojadas a literal translation for the word wetback In a wellestablished Mexican director released a film titled Espaldas Mojadas which intended to persuade Mexicans not to go to the United States It was a political film that incorporated all of the standard characters that would appear in countless other films and novels of the Chicano experience the wetback the pocho half Mexican the coyote smuggler who smuggles people into the United States and the grower Mister Sterling An ironic yet justified ending shows Mister Sterling dumped into the Rio Grande by Mexicans and as he swims to

often classified as a folk illness but has obvious medical symptoms The fontanelle on the top of an infants head is a membranecovered opening between two incompletely grown bones a soft spot that will disappear when the bones grow together as the child grows Mexican children are greatly guarded so la mollera will not fall and cause grave illness to the child The soft spot on the top of the head may fall if a child falls or is knocked around shaken too hard or suffers a trauma or an accident It is believed that la mollera has fallen when a baby becomes ill with ceaseless crying fever diarrhea and possibly vomiting Remedies for cada de mollera involve trying to return the fontanelle to its proper position This can be done by sucking on the soft spot by pushing upward on the roof of the infants mouth by holding the child upside down and patting the feet or by using a warm compress If the mollera is not repositioned death can occurThere is considerable evidence to support the idea that the concept of cada de mollera is of Aztec origin It is not a health concept found in Europe or even in other countries of Latin America The Aztecs believed in an inner force that provided warmth courage vitality and in children growth This force was known as tonalli and was found throughout the body but resided primarily in the head If this force was lost through violence or a trauma death could occur Children were especially at risk because this force could be lost through the fontanelle which was not yet fully closed By not cutting a childs hair and by watching the mollera and the head mothers took care to not lose the tonalli Some of the remedies for cada de mollera reportedly performed by the Aztecs are similar to those still used by Chicano families and curanderos Many of a childs symptoms as described by mothers can be linked to medical conditions such as dehydration which can occur from diarrheaLa mollera is also considered important as the child grows older Before entering a pool of water or getting wet at the beach many mothers insist that their children first wet the top of their heads so as not to catch a cold or another illness Mjese la mollera antes de entrar al agua children are instructed Some Mexican Americans refer to this condition as a Mexican folk disease because American doctors may not recognize the medical conditions Often the only person who can cure cada de mollera is a curanderaSee also CuranderismoReferences Clark Kay Martinez and Martin Ortiz de Montellano Roeder Trotter Ortiz de Montellano and Logan Moradas Penitente ChapelsA

Mexico in the year according to Bernal Diaz del Castillo There is documentation indicating it was staged by Juan de Oate in New Mexico in The drama originates in Aragn Spain during the twelfth century when Jaime I reconquered a region in southern Spain that was controlled by the Moors It used to be performed completely on horseback and seems to have traveled the world following the Spanish army into Mexico Cuba the Philippines British Guiana and California In Mexico it became a warlike spectacle involving many soldiers riding the best horses and wearing extravagant clothing Unlike the religious plays performed in New Mexico this one is secular Although it was traditionally performed on horseback since the Indians of New Mexico were not allowed to use horses they performed it as a dance The objective of the drama is to have the Moros steal the Holy Cross that sits in the center of a plaza and the Cristianos win it back by staging a sword battle between the two battalions of soldiers the Moors and the Christians Once the cross is returned to the Spaniards Christians the Moors infidels pledge obedience to the Spanish king The defeated Moors are forgiven and become Christians in the last scene In New Mexico the drama was staged to show the Indians that their subjection was already complete just as it happened to the Aztecs The ideological message is that enemies of the Spanish are not annihilated but rather absorbed as fellow subjects of the empire In New Mexico the famous Chimayo Moros y Cristianos continue to perform this drama up to the present day Leas book reproduces the dialogue of the drama and she states that no other complete copy exists of this the first play to be presented on the American continent In contemporary Spain the province of Alicante continues to have a major festival known as Las Fiestas de Moros y Cristianos that is a combination of religious and secular processions with up to lavishly costumed participants The festival is celebrated from three to four days with several battles taking place to win back the Holy Cross For a day or two the Moors are in the lead but eventually they lose to the ChristiansReferences Aceves Gutirrez Harris Lamadrid Lea La Muerte DeathDeath personified as a woman and dressed in white clothing is a wellknown character in Chicano and Mexicano folklore Commonly accepted as just La Muerte she is a frequent personality in legends urban belief tales and is integrated into many family folk belief systems Death is sometimes feared but it is also accepted as the transition to another stage of the life cycle A common saying is De la muerte y la suerte nadie se escapa No one escapes from death or luck Espinosa A M She habitually appears late at night to men who are out alone some intentionally others innocently on their way home from work In tales collected in the Southwest La Muerte is seen standing at streetlights or waiting by a bridge or the side of the road She appears to be a beautiful young voluptuous woman wearing a long flowing white dress with her face covered or averted Once she is picked up and seated in the car or on the horse she shows her face to her victim She has no face what the men see is a skull In South Texas she is called La Vieja Blanca the old lady in white and she acts as a siren enticing men but when they get a look at her face they see her hideous white skull instead The men faint run away or become deathly ill of susto fright In most tales of La Muerte her appearances occur after midnight to men who have nonmoral or immoral schemes The basic structure of the legend of La Muerte will involve a man alone at night in his car buggy or he may be on a horse and he sees a woman in white often with blond hair standing by the side of the road or near a river The man is immediately attracted and wants the woman but when he gets near her and sees the skull face he faints and hours later awakens in the hospital with his wife and family surrounding him Tales of La Muerte are narrated by relatives parents grandparents and friends to reinforce an adherence to social cultural norms and marital fidelity The legend of the appearance of another woman La Llorona is structurally similar to stories of La Muerte and sometimes the same story will use both characters interchangeablyLa Muerte is also known as Doa Sebastiana in New Mexico

Chicano barrios The development of Chicano Muralismo grew out of the political context of the Chicano civil rights movement a nationalistic political struggle waged by Chicanos during the s It imitated the Mexican mural art that was created during the postrevolutionary period of Mexicos history and was intended to promote political action and raise consciousness In California the mural movement started about It involved a variety of interested individuals as described by Alicia Gonzales The emergent Chicano Mural Movement brought together the selftaught artist the signpainter the house painter the massproduction painter from the billboard companies the college art student and the graffiti artist A statewide meeting of Chicano mural artists was held in September of as a means of developing cooperation and communication for the artists working throughout California The early murals were considered public folk art because of the common themes of community and civil rights and because most of the murals were located in workingclass neighborhoods and urban barrios Often these early murals were referred to as a peoples art This concept was well expressed by a group of women artists in San Francisco who called themselves Mujeres Muralistas women muralists Our interest as artists is to put art close to where it needs to be Close to the children close to the old people close to everyone who has to walk or ride the buses to get places We want our art either out in the streets or in places where a lot of people go each day the hospitals health centers clinics restaurants and other public places Cockcroft Weber and Cockcroft The scenes of many early Chicano murals consisted of preColumbian indigenous themes and motifs that reflected a mestizo mixedrace heritage and a Mexican cultural nationalism Images of Aztln a concept from the preConquest and other Aztec symbols represented cultural pride and national loyalty Chicano and Chicana artists turned to symbols that portrayed the traditions of Chicanos traditions that distinguished them from mainstream American culture These images can still be found in murals located in Chicano communities across the United States Chicano muralists followed the tradition of the Mexican muralists Diego Rivera David Alfaro Siqueiros and Jos Clemente Orozco and used murals to rewrite the history of the Chicano experience Murals were also intended to educate the community on the antiquity and ancestry of the Mexicano What was not provided in textbooks and the classroom was flashed across walls in Chicano neighborhoods The Chicano muralists sought to paint the history they knew a history often based on oral traditions legends and myths Romo Finally as Toms YbarraFrausto explains Chicanoa art reflects a

the romantic story of a handsome Mexican highwayman considered a bandit by history but a great folk hero by Chicanos At a time when the Mexican people were terribly mistreated in California it is believed that Murrieta was falsely accused of crimes he did not commit and this prompted him to fight for his rights and those of his people Joaqun Murrieta whose name is also spelled Murieta and Murietta roamed the back roads and hills of northern and southern California from Mount Shasta to the Mexican border in the mids stealing horses and robbing Yankees and Chinese alike There have been countless books chapters and articles written about Murrieta or about the legend of this famous Mexican bandito According to the legend Joaqun Murrieta was born in Sonora Mexico and migrated to California with his new bride in search of gold He became a bandit and robber after many wrongs were committed against him by Americans There are several variants of his story but all have a similar general theme as to why and how he became a banditDuring the mids there were at least five men named Joaqun all of whom are credited with committing robberies and banditry There was Joaqun Murrieta Joaqun Valenzuela Joaqun Carrillo Joaqun Ocomorena and Joaqun Botilleras Some say that Valenzuela and Ocomorena were one and the same and when he was hanged two Joaquns were eliminated Although it is possible that Murrieta used all of these names as aliases it is likely that there were at least two Joaquns at the time Murrieta started his life of banditry and crime after his home was invaded by white miners who raped his wife Rosa and beat up Joaqun Later he and his brother Carlos were accused of stealing a horse a crime for which Carlos was lynched and Joaqun floggedThere have been over twentyone published versions of the Joaqun Murrieta legend The first and for many years the one considered most authentic was by John Rollin Ridge serialized in the California Police Gazette and eventually published under the title of The Life and Adventures of Joaqun Murrieta the Celebrated California Bandit in John Rollin Ridge a Cherokee also known as Yellow Bird wrote his story one year after the death of Murrieta This is the basic story of Joaqun that all subsequent histories are based on In the California Police Gazette printed Ridges story in ten installments and this publicity helped to further disseminate the story The book was translated into French and Spanish and for many years it was better known abroad than in this country In doubting the details of the Murrieta legend researchers go back to Ridges version which some say was based on newspaper stories about the various bandits named Joaqun It is believed by some researchers that Ridge just applied the name Murrieta to the Joaqun that was finally captured and decapitated As a Native American Ridge identified with the discriminatory treatment of California Mexicans and he stated that he wanted to do justice to the MexicansJoaqun Murrietas life has been depicted in novels stories newspaper serials and movies Charles E B Howe wrote a play about Joaqun in that covers his escapades from the spring of to July the day he was captured and killed by Captain Harry Love It is not known if the play was ever performed but the portrayal of Murrieta is moving and especially interesting because of all the negative publicity following his capture and death Howe portrays him as an aristocratic intelligent leader and a man who commits crimes to avenge the wrongs committed against himself and his countrymenJoseph Henry Jacksons work traces the history of the legend claiming all the information came from the John Rollin Ridge version and that he should be credited with starting the fictitious legend Although Jackson does quote from the San Francisco Alta newspaper demonstrating that many people suspected it was not Joaqun Murrieta who was killed and decapitated by Captain Harry Love but quite possibly another Joaqun every murder and robbery in the country has been attributed to Joaqun Sometimes it is Joaqun Carrillo that has committed all these crimes then it is Joaqun Murrieta then Joaqun something else but always Joaqun Jackson Marcus Stewart wrote a long epic poem in titled Rosita A California Tale in which he speculates on the life of Murrieta In this poem Joaqun lives and flees in a ship to Mexico or South America and the body that is decapitated is actually that of his good friend Ramn Ramns girlfriend Rosita also disappears at the time of his death and only after her death thirty years later is it revealed that she had been living the life of a man This story is commingled with the story of Charlotte Charlie Parkhurst who lived as a man in California during the latter half of the nineteenth century The Murrieta legend has also been written by Latinos and Europeans and Pablo Neruda the Nobel Prize winner wrote an opera about Murrieta entitled Splendor and Death of Joaqun Murrieta insisting that Joaqun was actually Chileno and not MexicanArnold Rojas a Californian vaquero writer and memoirist writes that Joaqun Murrieta was from the city of Alamos Sonora Mexico where church records show that he and Rosita were married When his wife was raped and he was beaten Murrieta saw the faces of his murderers According to Rojas Joaqun lived for revenge and he searched every mining camp in California until he found all thirteen men who committed the crime and killed them After this he returned to Sonora to live out his life Supposedly he is buried in Cucurpe SonoraMajor Horace Bell states In any country in America except the United States the bold defiance of the power of the government a half years successful resistance a continuous conflict with the military and civil authorities and the armed populacethe writer repeats that in any other country in America other than the United Statesthe operations of Joaqun Murrieta would have been dignified by the title of revolution and the leader with that of rebel chief For there is little doubt in the writers mind that Joaquns aims were higher than that of mere revenge and pillage it is easy to perceive that Joaqun felt himself to be more the champion of his countrymen than an outlaw and an enemy to the human race Chicanos have taken the legend of Joaqun Murrieta seriously and identify with his heroic exploits of stealing from the rich and giving to the poor He is viewed as a social bandit and a cultural leader and several corridos ballads describe his life and death At the University of California in Berkeley a Chicano cooperative student house first established in is named Casa Joaqun Murrieta after this famous folk heroReferences Bell Castillo and Camarillo HerreraSobek b Howe

Jesus Christ in the manger but a nacimiento can also include other Christmasrelated images biblical scenes and possibly artifacts relating to the life experiences of the creator The set of the nacimiento can vary in size from a small table to half a room or to the whole front yard of a home Outdoor nacimientos will have lifesize figures of Mary and Joseph and various other biblical characters and animals This custom is not particular to the Chicano community and nativity scenes can be found throughout the country during the Christmas season It is thought that Saint Francis of Assisi is the saint responsible for much of the veneration of the infant Jesus and the custom of creating nativity scenes or monuments to the birth of Christ has been going on for hundreds of yearsIn

the traditional way of life of the Hispano community of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries Fabiola Cabeza de Baca Nina OteroWarren and Cleofas Jaramillo each produced several books that present the folklore rituals and customs of the New Mexicans Rebolledo discusses how these women used their writings as narrative strategies of resistance because they saw their culture and way of life slowly eroding away and being assimilated by a dominant and foreign culture Because they all came from upperclass families they were educated in Spanish traditions and language and consequently ignored the mestizo mixedrace and indigenous aspects of the culture often depicting their past in romantic pastoral terms Nevertheless they all wrote of the loss of land and loss of culture and sought to preserve the folklore customs and stories of their grandparents close friends and those who worked for themThe Penitentes the ancient religious brotherhood have attracted much research and been

yard to commemorate a deceased relative or as a fulfillment of a vow In some parts of the Southwest these outdoor shrines are also called grutas grottos and the two words are often used

that radiate from the cross It is a wellknown symbol among Chicanos and has been traced to the era of the pachucos s urban youth hence its name It is also known as the cruz del barrio cross from the neighborhood and has been found throughout major cities of the Southwest Tattoos of Christian images have always been popular among Chicanos and the custom of tattooing images of Jesus Christ crucifixes La Virgen de Guadalupe and other Madonnas has a long history In the Middle Ages the Crusaders cut a cross into Christian converts on the hand a little above the wrist Some social scientists believe that the pachuco cross was meant to symbolize violence and membership in a gang But it is known that it was used as an initiation ritual among friends and peers to show solidarity and allegiance to a particular barrio In describing the tattooed cross Haldeen Braddy is of the opinion that each ray jetting out from the cross represented a sixmonth stay in jail In his view pachucos liked to stay in the jaula cage jail so that they could accumulate these rays as souvenirs of their imprisonment There is no evidence to support this speculationReferences Barker Braddy Chicano Pinto

US culture and from Mexican American urban life also The first appearance of pachucos was in the El PasoJurez area during the s and early s It is thought the word pachuco was a colloquial way of referring to El Paso A person from El Paso was referred to as del pachuco Sometimes a person considered a pachuco was called a chuco Haldeen Braddy discusses the origin of the word pachuco providing several theories One is that the pachucos of the s came from the city of Pachuca in the state of Hidalgo Mexico He also presents the definition from the Diccionario General de Americanismos stating that pachuca is a fivecard poker hand in which all the cards are of different suits or in other words a poker hand with no value a losing hand Braddy believes this well describes the pachucos of El Paso The other theory is that pachuco comes from the Nahuatl word pachtli which refers to a grass like hay that grows parasitically on treesPachucos were identifiable by their clothing hairstyles and a distinct language with its own vocabulary The men wore zoot suits that is pegged pants long coats with padded shoulders and pancake hats Their hair was worn long and slicked back with a ducktail effect Some also wore a long chain hanging from their pants well displayed and connected to a belt Pachucas were the girlfriends of the pachucos but they also had a dress style all their own They wore short very tight skirts with their hair high and long Makeup was heavy especially around the eyes Supposedly they were very streetwise and liked to hang out with their pachuco boyfriendsLarge numbers of young men from El Paso speaking the pachuco argot settled in Los Angeles during the early s and it was there that they became recognized as an identifiable group and considered to be gang members Young men who relocated and settled in Los Angeles even for short periods of time upon returning home to the small towns of the Southwest would spread the pachuco beliefs and jargon to their communities In this way pachuquesmo a Mexican subculture became known throughout the SouthwestThe pachuco speech a combination of English and Spanish also called cal was a fascinating fusion drawing from many linguistic sources Cal was originally the language of the Spanish gypsies or a dialect of Spanish showing traces of many languages acquired by the gypsies throughout their world wanderings The pachuco argot utilized several linguistic sources in developing a vocabulary or jargon These sources were southwestern Spanish the older archaic Spanish from New Mexico Mexican slang standard Spanish from Mexico City and also words invented by the pachucos themselves The pachuco dialect was the product of an urban environment and it is believed the language may have originated in the underworld and drug scene of El Paso George Carpenter Barker pinpoints almost exactly where the pachuco jargon originated from the X gang who first met in the neighborhood of Florence and Eighth Streets in El Paso Arthur Campa believes that pachucos originated as a linguistic group first and had no distinctive dress style That came later as they moved into a more stable economic environment and had some financial resourcesExpressions and vocabulary used by Chicanos today come from the pachuco argot of the s For example such words as rale whats happening or OK bato guy as in bato loco califas California hay te wuacho Ill be seeing you and la pinta jailprison have been used for generations The film Zoot Suit written and directed by Luis Valdez in depicts the dress language and problems of Mexican American youth and especially pachucos in Los Angeles in the sDuring the s a caricature of the pachuco was created for the Mexican media in the person of Tin Tan whose real name was Germn Valdz He was an actor and performer who dressed as a stereotypical pachuco and zootsuiter Tin Tan made several Mexican films portraying the Mexican American pocho who codeswitches between English and Spanish and speaks calThe pachuco was disdained in the US by both the Mexican American and Anglo communities and likewise in Mexico by the media and the intellectuals Octavio Paz much quoted disparagingly discusses the phenomenon of the pachuco in his book The Labyrinth of Solitude published in English in Although almost any urban Chicano who was young in the s was affected by the style and language of the pachuco the stereotypic pachuco was often associated with violence and deviancy The zootsuit riots of are held up as the epitome of the pachuco experience totally disregarding previous and later experiences According to Alfredo Mirand The pachuco has been an especially visible symbol of cultural autonomy and resistance His distinctive dress demeanor mannerism and language not only express his manhood but set him off culturally from the dominant society To be a chuco is to be proud dignified and to uphold ones personal integrity as well as the honor and integrity of the group It is at once an affirmation of ones manhood and ones culture The pachuco is the precursor to the bato loco the cholo and the low rider of more contemporary timesThe pachuca was the counterpart of the pachuco of the s but also the homegirl archetype that comes together in the young Chicana growing up in an urban ghettoized environment During the s pachucas were the girlfriends of or those who hung around with pachucos They developed their own style of dress wearing very tight short skirts and sweaters and doing their hair in a pompadour style Their behavior was loud and brash they smoked cigarettes in public wore lots of eye makeup and supposedly were quick to fight Pachucas knew the vernacular of the times speaking pachuco and scandalizing their families

Vigil Paredes Amrico Considered the foremost scholar of Chicano folklore Amrico Paredes was a professor emeritus of English and anthropology at the University of Texas Austin His classic work With His Pistol in His Hand A Border Ballad and Its Hero first published in has become a standard work in Chicano studies and American folklore A whole generation of Chicano scholars regard Paredes as their intellectual role model and mentor and his original research on Chicano folklore engendered a new wave of scholarship and academic achievementsAs a young man Paredes was always interested in music corridos ballads and singing His early published scholarship focused on ballads and ballad heroes of the TexasMexican border and through this research he developed a theory about the formation of Chicano folklore The resistance to an encroaching foreign culture the loss of political and economic power feelings of social marginality and the resulting conflict of cultures all contributed to the creation of folklore in the form of legends jokes and songs by the Chicano people His research and publications encompass various disciplines from anthropology to literature to social historyAmrico Paredes was born in Brownsville Texas on September He attended Brownsville Junior College in the early s earning an AA degree in In he joined the army wrote for the military newspaper Stars and Stripes and worked in Japan for a couple of years Returning to Texas in he earned a BA degree from the University of Texas in an MA in and a PhD in The distinguishing feature of Paredess scholarship has been his humanistic approach to conducting research Besides knowing and studying his own culture and ethnic community he was able to bring another consciousness to the study of folklore in general and to TexasMexican folklore in particular He taught that the examination of a cultural or folkloric phenomenon cannot be divorced from the social context in which it is performed or expressed Before the publication of Paredess work most of the Hispanic and Chicano folklore collected was classified published and placed on a library shelf Paredess research emphasized the importance of the informants culture and the social setting and history of the community of the informant It was in his book With His Pistol in His Hand A Border Ballad and Its Hero that Paredes proposed his theory of the development of Chicano folklore through a process of cultural conflict generated by the invasion of Anglo culture and values into south Texas in the s Many writers have dedicated their books to him and the journal Aztln devoted a doubleissue volume to him in Besides publishing over sixty articles in academic journals he was editor of the Journal of American Folklore from to and published

is written in verse and performed on Christmas Eve It is an ancient mystery play brought to the New World by the Spanish Franciscan priests and is performed throughout the Southwest As a folk production it is performed for entertainment but it is also a religious presentation that is maintaining a long tradition The full title means the dialogue of the shepherds and it is an interpretation of the dialogue and reaction the shepherds may have had when they learned of the birth of Jesus Christ It narrates the story of the shepherds who are visited by Michael the Archangel who informs them of the birth of the infant Jesus and urges them to go to Beln Bethlehem Before the shepherds decide what to do they are visited by Lucifer who is angry about the birth of the Christ child to the Virgin Mary Lucifer tries to challenge the shepherds but Michael the Archangel returns just in time to defeat him The shepherds then continue on their journey to Bethlehem bringing gifts for the infant Jesus The structure of the play is formulaic and so the sequence of acts can be rearranged into many different patterns with jokes songs speeches and other events added at different points The underlying story of the drama is the universal battle between good and evil It has evolved from the literature of sixteenthcentury Spain and the indigenous traditions of Mexico and for this reason the play has provided a political format for the poor masses throughout the last yearsBecause of its ancient history there are many variants of Los Pastores and several versions have developed a comic dialogue between Lucifer and Cucharn Bartolo and the other characters One character is named Bato as in bato loco crazy guy a phrase of contemporary usage among Chicanos today Variants of this play have been collected in Texas New Mexico and California and it has been performed in Mexico since the sixteenth century In San Antonio the performance of Los Pastores at Our Lady of Guadalupe Church as

formally known as La Fraternidad Piadosa de Nuestro Padre de Jesus Nazareo or informally as Los Penitentes This lay religious society related to the Roman Catholic Church is still found in rural northern New Mexico and southern Colorado Originally it was organized for religious observances and practices including pious prayer and bodily penance but the society eventually became very important in providing mutual aid to the local communities Los Penitentes cared for the sick arranged funerals and conducted the religious rituals associated with wakes Their social role in contemporary New Mexico is not as pronounced but some moradas still remain activeTheir primary religious ceremonies commemorated the passion and death of Jesus Christ during the celebrations of Semana Santa Holy Week It is speculated that the starting date of the brotherhood is somewhere between and The origins of Los Penitentes have been debated for years but it is likely they were heavily influenced by the Franciscan Third Order who were the friars in New Mexico until Mexico separated from Spain in Los Penitentes became a strong institution in rural New Mexico because there were too few Catholic priests to oversee the religious life of the people during the early nineteenth century The village chapters governed themselves without benefit of the few priests in the colony Consequently Los Penitentes had strong influences in conserving the language and culture of the Spanish Americans of New Mexico Membership consisted of between thirty and fifty adult men per chapter called moradas and were divided into two groups common members called hermanos disciplantes brothers who discipline and officers called hermanos de luz brothers of light By the early twentieth century the various chapters had become secret societies with restricted membershipJournalism about Los Hermanos Penitentes has been sensationalistic with lengthy descriptions of their Semana Santa rituals especially when Anglo Americans migrated to New Mexico during the late nineteenth century Their custom of selfpunishment in the form of flagellation during the Holy Week ceremonies aroused much interest and was reported widely in many East Coast publications The most sensitive and nonjudgmental writing and research have been conducted by de Cordova Henderson Sprott and Weigle A worthy contemporary descriptive account

for each customer and after each purchase hed drop a bean into it After the total number of beans reached sixteen or eighteen the customer was given six cents in money or goods This was the piln a type of dividend given to the client for purchasing from the same merchantThe phrase de piln is used when referring to the occurrence of an unplanned episode or accident In narrating a personal story with an unhappy ending an individual might add Y de piln me ca and to top it off I fell down Although it is not found in common usage among contemporary Chicanos many will remember how their parents used this expression The word has several meanings including a heap of stuff such as a heap of grapes a heap of mortar a heap of something but it also means a lump of sugar In her personal memoir A

festivities and other parties Often it is decorated as a star or an animal such as a burro or elephant but it can also be a fruit or a puppet The size varies from small to very large Piatas have traditionally been a part of birthday and Christmas celebrations but are now also brought out for other holidays In Mexico a piata was always broken on Christmas Eve especially among the poorer classes so that children would receive small inexpensive gifts from the piata The real Christmas gifts were not presented until Da de los Reyes on January also known as Epiphany in the Catholic calendarA game is made of breaking the piata and a song accompanies the game The piata is hung from a tree with a long rope that is manipulated by an adult who is able to move the piata up and down so it wont be broken too quickly A child is blindfolded twirled around three times handed a bat and led to the piata Everyone will usually have a turn or two and finally the manipulator allows someone to break it The candy and prizes fall to the ground and everyone jumps to grab someThe custom of breaking a piata during the Christmas Mass celebrations was introduced by the Augustine priests in the seventeenth century Later the custom of celebrating many Christmas Masses evolved into Las Posadas Christmas pageant The piata was considered to be a symbol of evil with the clay pot representing Satan or his spirit and the colorful decorations serving to tempt humanity The candies and goodies inside the piata were the unknown pleasures that Satan held out to attract man The blindfolded child was supposed to represent innocence and faith which must be blind to combat the evil spirit The breaking of the piata symbolized the struggle that man must sustain to destroy evil and receive the gifts and pleasures of God the candyThe word piata derives from the verb apiar which means to cram tie or join together In Italy pignattas were hung from the ceilings during masquerade balls It is accepted that there is an oriental influence since piatas are always decorated with colorful crepe paper It is thought piatas originated in China and were brought to Sicily and Spain by the Arabs and

written about the formation of gangs in prisons as a means of surviving incarceration in the United States The media including Minutes has done stories about the activities of the Mexican mafia and La

speech Santana the movie character represents it in the stylized walk and prose of a pinto a stance honed in the corridors behind prison walls or in the barrios of East LA The pinto experience is a subculture of the Chicano experience Because of the low socioeconomic status of a large percentage of Chicanos in the United States and the lack of equal opportunities in education and employment many Chicano families have been inadvertently introduced to this subculture A special issue of the Chicano magazine De Colores vol no was devoted to Los Pintos de America and the issue was published as a

word placa means an insignia of an order and in the United States it also means the license plates of a car But within cholo and youth gang culture it refers to the sign and name of a gang or club as it appears on the walls of buildings in the barrios of Chicano communities What may appear as graffiti is actually the placa of a person or of a gang Where the placa appears signifies that territory as belonging to that gang and it may also serve as a challenge to other gangs The use of public walls for asserting a fraternal identity is really an ancient tradition and within Chicano culture it can be traced back to at least the s Chicano street culture uses plaqueasos as a system for conveying information about territory and youth socialization customs If one placa is written over by the placa of another gang it is accepted as a challenge to a confrontationA placa also refers to the individual name of a gang member Nicknames are very common among Chicanos but a placa is specifically a gangrelated name and often very well describes the person as perceived by friends or other gang members Names such as Sad Girl Diablo devil Joker and Malo bad could be names used within a gang and may signify sadness wildness or craziness Sometimes the writing of names on walls is referred to as plaqueasos or in contemporary terms barrio calligraphy In more recent times the individual who writes on walls has been called a tagger and the art of writing is tagging Many Chicano taggers use a stylized medieval writing such as Old English and German Gothic formsSanchezTranquilino has analyzed the

linguistically The word can also mean discolored truncated or small It has been adopted by some Chicanos to describe and ridicule themselves as they survive within an antagonistic and discriminatory environment The word became more nationally known in with the publication of the novel Pocho by Jose Antonio Villarreal which depicted the comingofage of a Chicano growing up in the Santa Clara Valley of California during the sMexicans like to call Chicanos pocho ridiculing their sometimes poor Spanish and their lack of knowledge about Mexico and Mexican customs Mexicans who have spent time in the United States and have acquired the mannerisms values and the English language may be considered pochos because theyve become agringados anglicized In the s and s the Mexican cinema produced several

PageantA tradition marking the beginning of the Christmas season with the dramatization of the search for lodging in Bethlehem by Joseph and Mary It always includes a procession with singing and music and starts nine days before Christmas The story in the form of a novena Catholic ninedays devotion is based on the gospel of St Luke For nine consecutive nights before Christmas Eve la Noche Buena the good night los peregrinos the pilgrims representing Joseph and Mary visit a different home each night reenacting the search for an inn by Joseph and Mary Los mesoneros those who portray the innkeepers keep refusing them lodging Los peregrinos form a procession and children and angels handcarry the small figures of the Holy Family When they arrive at a home they ask for shelter and sing carols Las Posadas occurs from December through December Nine different homes are opened to the pilgrims and food and drink are offered after the peregrinos have been denied lodging Most homes will have a nativity scene a nacimiento set up for the prayers and singers An important tradition of these festivities is the piata that is brought out and broken by the children There is evidence that piatas originated from this Christmas celebrationPosadas are still held today in many Mexican communities in the United States Some are organized by church groups but recently others have been organized for commercial purposes by city entities The reenactment of Las Posadas is an ancient tradition that can be traced back to the early conquest in Mexico and to the christianization of the Aztecs by the Augustine priests They originated in the small village of San Augustin Acolman located near the pyramids in Teotihuacn The Aztecs celebrated the birth of their god Huitzilopochtli for one night and celebrations were held all of the following day in every home This occurred about the same time of the year that the Catholic Church celebrated the birth of Christ The Augustine priests saw the similarity between these Aztec celebrations and the Christmas festivities and chose this opportunity to teach the new religion to the Aztecs While the Aztecs were celebrating the birth of Huitzilopochtli the priests reenacted the pilgrimage of Mary and Joseph The nine nightly journeys symbolize the nine months of pregnancy for Mary These Christmas Masses as they were called were celebrated in the convents and churches but eventually were moved to the haciendas farms and ranches and finally to the neighborhoods The celebrations ended with firecrackers and the breaking of a piata Today many cities in the Southwest reenact this pilgrimage for one night with a procession winding through city streets In Monterey California the whole city comes out for Las Posadas and in San

underground to get the bones of the ancients After the end of the Fourth Sun an Aztec era when the ancient people have been drowned or changed into fish the spirits decide he should go seek the bones in order to start a new race He must try three times overcoming many obstacles before he succeeds in bringing the bones to the sky They are ground to a powder and placed in a bowl by the goddess Cihuacoatl The other gods shed blood into the bowl and humans are born Quetzalcoatl discovered corn which he brought for the new humans to eat He saw an ant bringing a kernel of corn from inside a mountain and he changed himself into an ant and followed it Lightning was used to split open the mountain to bring the corn to the people He left the Toltecs to return to his home It just happened that Quetzalcoatl promised to return in the same year that Hernn Corts landed in Veracruz It was to the Spaniards advantage to use the Indians belief in Quetzalcoatls return Corts was well received because he was thought to be Quetzalcoatl and the conquest of the Aztecs by the Spaniards was legitimizedQuetzalcoatl is one of the betterknown Aztec gods and has been greatly idealized by the moderns

from the Spanish word quince meaning fifteen and aera which together mean the fifteenyearold This celebration marks the beginning of adulthood for a young woman It is a custom throughout Latin America Mexico the Caribbean and in many areas of the United States to distinguish this birthday with a special observance It is assumed the custom has origins in preColumbian cultures as a comingofage ritual for young women In his Historia de Nueva Espaa Bernardino de Sahagn narrates that it was traditional for the parents of a young Aztec maiden to formally acknowledge her passage into womanhood Advice of an Aztec Mother to Her Daughter is reprinted in William H Prescotts The Conquest of MexicoCommunities in Texas have formally observed Quinceaera birthdays for many generations whereas such celebrations are not as common in California and other parts of the Southwest Traditionally this ceremony serves as a comingout party to indicate that a girl has reached womanhood and is ready for marriage In the United States this is no longer the case but the celebration does symbolize the transition from childhood to womanhood In some celebrations a doll called la mueca de los recuerdos the doll of memories or la ltima mueca the last doll is given to the celebrant as a symbol of the childhood she is leaving behind Some people see it as the last vestiges of childhood and la ltima mueca as the last doll she will ever receiveAlthough not a religious sacrament the celebrations of Quinceaeras take on a strong religious undertone The ceremony usually includes a special Mass where the parents give thanks for having a wonderful daughter and she gives thanks for having a wonderful family and the young woman may receive a formal blessing from the priest The Mass is very similar to a wedding Mass with the celebrant and her entourage slowly marching down the center aisle of the church A ceremonial dinner and a dance with live band music usually follow The celebrant wears a long white gown similar to a wedding dress has fifteen maids damas with their escorts chambelanes and sometimes performs a choreographed dance or waltz Quinceaera celebrations are held in major cities with large Latino populations such as Miami San Antonio Chicago Los Angeles and El Paso These cities now offer many businesses that cater to Latino families planning Quinceaera celebrations Although this is a family tradition and ritual some families use the occasion to lavish on their daughters an extravagant day never to be forgottenBesides the traditional doll other folkloric elements continue to be incorporated into Quinceaera ceremonies In Idaho and Oregon Eva Castellano has continued a tradition she learned from Mexico of making coronas crowns made of waxed and paper flowers to be worn by the young girl Only unmarried girls wear the coronas which symbolize innocence and purity Much of the research on Quinceaeras shows that families want to maintain a cultural historical tradition and

publisher of contemporary Chicano literature in the s based in Berkeley California was named Quinto Sol Publications Worship of the sun was an integral part of Aztec culture The sun was viewed as a warrior with the solar rays as his darts Time consisted of a fiftytwoyear calendar that was divided into five ages or series of ages called Suns The first age was the Age of the Earth Sun and the god was Tezcatlipoca whose familiar animal was the jaguar The second age was the Age of Great Winds the sun was Quetzalcoatl and the age ended with great hurricanes Then came the Age of Fire with the sun Tlaloc and it ended with volcanic eruptions Next was the Age of Floods with the goddess of waters Chalchiuhtlicue as the fourth sun This age ended when the sky fell upon the earth and the waters gushed up turning men into fish The present and fifth age El Quinto Sol has Nanahuatl also known as Tonatiuh as the god and it is the Age of Earthquakes With El Quinto Sol a full culture was created with maize grown for the first time fire domesticated and the creation of the Toltecs This age is supposed to end with earthquakes Each age came about when the god of an aeon died or sacrificed himself to be reborn as the sun of the next aeonReferences Bierhorst Brundage Florescano Griffith Ranchera Country SongIt is accepted that the word ranchera refers to a type of Mexican song although sometimes it is an adjective that describes a character or a type of person Ranchera comes from the word rancho meaning a cattle ranch farm or rural settlement A poor unsophisticated person may be called a ranchero or ranchera implying he or she is from the countryside the sticks and a hick In the context of Mexican folk music la cancin ranchera is a love song sung by the common folk the peasants of the rural countryside After the Mexican Revolution rancheras became more agreeable to the upper classes because of the movement toward a Mexican identity and nationalism and a rejection of European cultural values The modern cancin ranchera was made popular in Mexico City in the early s by the songwriter Jos Alfredo Jimenez The poetic structure of the ranchera is brief and simple yet emotionally it is very intense According to Rubn Campos as quoted by Gradante it is a moan and a sigh the briefest form of composition and as such requires a greater intensity of expression than any other compositional form It must say precisely what it means The themes of rancheras are love and unrequited love but from the point of view of the ordinary common man Rancheras express the poetry of the masses The famous ranchera singer Amalia Mendoza states the cancin ranchera expresses the sensibility of the masses and reaches them thus its popularity One might say that the cancin ranchera reflects the personality of the masses because it expresses something vital that we all have in common Gradante The ranchera originated in Mexico but is very popular in the United States among Mexicans and Chicanos Jos Alfredo Jimenez wrote over songs many becoming classics that continue to be sung today by younger artists that have a universal sentiment that speaks to the hearts of Chicanos Because of the style of these romantic songs sung to Mariachi music and sung in Spanish untranslatable rancheras express the epitome of Mexicanness The musical poetics arouse emotional sentiments about lost loves nostalgia and by extension about being Mexican Songs such as Ella Her Camino de Guanajuato Road to Guanajuato La Vida no Vale Nada Life Has No Value and Llego Borracho el Borracho The Drunk Arrived Drunk all elicit memories of fathers grandfathers and stories of Mexico Many are drinking songs frequently shown in movies being sung in cantinas bars but they are also dancing songs so they are played at celebrations and family gatherings Although rancheras are intensely male centered there are several female singers who became famous singing rancheras such as Lola Beltran Lucha Villa and Amalia Mendoza The performance of rancheras is always dramatic and emotional whether performed by men or women and the audience can always empathize with the situations depicted in the verses The life experiences portrayed in the songs of Jos Alfredo Jimenez who came from a povertystricken background himself are about the struggles of Everyman the need for social acceptance personal happiness and some type of financial security These are concerns that the average Mexicano and Chicano can identify with Although most rancheras speak of love other life situations found in the songs deal with fortune destiny and lifes choices In Camino de Guanajuato these existential words open the songNo vale nada la vidaLa vida no vale nadaComienza siempre llorandoY as llorando se acabaOf no value is lifeLife is worth nothingIt always begins with weepingAnd with weeping it endsReferences Gradante Pea a bRascuache Downtrodden FolkAlso spelled rascuachi rasquache rasquachi and rasquachismo this Mexican word characterizes a poor peoples and workingclass peoples worldview and defines how engaging and cultural beauty is created by them It means that in spite of poverty a pleasurable outlook on life inculcates a perspective that results in the creation of a pleasing cultural environment composed of whatever elements are available These elements may be art home decorating entertainment language the creation of religious objects altars anything connected to the creation of a special and spiritual life For an individual it defines an attitude a sensibility or a social condition It can describe the car the house clothes a whole way of life The Diccionario de Mejicanismos defines rascuache as pobre a miserable person poor lowly wretched The rascuaches are the downtrodden the lowly people persona que no vale nada person that is worth nothing In English it could be interpreted as funky humble unsophisticated What is most important about the concept of rascuache is that it captures a propensity or an aesthetic according to YbarraFrausto to persevere and make whatever one possesses or has at hand work well together All resources are considered riches and an inventiveness in the use of available resources results in a rascuache lifestyle Whether one is cooking a meal dressing for a party assembling a garden or decorating a Christmas tree and nativity scene a rascuache sensibility will ensure that the final outcome will be elaborate colorful an unrestrained aggregate of rich resources This aesthetic can be observed in the creation of yard shrines graveyard sites and in home decorating YbarraFrausto has written a wonderful essay about rasquachismo that shows how Chicanos incorporate this spirit in the cultural life of the community In his words Rasquachismo is brash and hybrid sending shudders through the ranks of the elite who seek solace in less exuberant more muted and purer traditions To be rasquache is to be down but not out b This underclass aesthetic was vigorously exhibited by El Teatro Campesino the Farmworkers Theater in the creation of the stock characters that constituted the core of the Teatros actos dramas In the s the group created and successfully performed a play called La Carpa de los Rasquachis The Tent of the Rasquachis about a family named Rasquachi The figure of el pelado the clown distinctly exemplifies the rascuache outlook the underdog figure who is both victim and hero at the same time a Cantinflas archetype The prototype of the rascuache character was Pito Perez the protagonist of the novel La Vida Intil de Perez The Futile Life of Pito Perez by Jose Ruben Romero first published in and reprinted many times most recently in and also Don Chipote of Las Aventuras de Don Chipote written by Daniel Venegas in a journalist who lived in Los AngelesSee also Carpas El Pelado El Teatro CampesinoReferences BroylesGonzalez MesaBains YbarraFrausto bLa Raza The PeopleThe literal translation of this term is the race but it has come to be used as an ingroup name for Mexican and Chicano people Translated as the people it is recognized as meaning all mixedrace Spanish and Indian people known as mestizos The term encompasses all Latinos Latin Americans who are descendents of the Spanish and Indian encounter The Mexican intellectual Jos Vasconcelos wrote a book in titled La Raza Csmica Misin de la Raza Iberoamericana Publishing after the Mexican Revolution Vasconcelos envisioned the successful future of Mexico to lie in the strong bonds of its mixedrace population Before the Revolution in the nineteenth century Mexicans looked toward a European identity and most of the upper classes considered themselves white Europeans The indigenous population of Mexico was segregated and not racially mixed and the mestizos were more closely aligned with the Indians than with the upper classes Vasconcelos wrote his slim volume in his search for a Mexican identity for himself and for Mexicos population La Raza is used by Chicanos because they identify as mestizo people and see themselves as members of a special race a group of people with a distinct heritage and destiny Chicano writers artists professionals musicians and students are invigorated by the proclamation of La Raza and inspired to work toward a creative and political unity In the words of Jose Angel Gutirrez as quoted by Arnoldo Vento La Raza is the affirmation of the most basic ingredient of our personality the brownhood of our Indian ancestors wedded to all the other skin colors of mankind As children of La Raza we are heirs of a spiritual and biological miracle The Viva la Raza chant is a frequent opening and closing statement at festivities concerts political meetings anywhere Chicanos might come together In the s the first political party to be formed by Chicanos in the US was called La Raza Unida Party October known in the United States as Columbus Day is celebrated throughout Latin America as Da de la Raza or Day of the People It is celebrated by New York Puerto Ricans and Cubans and Chicanos throughout the country It marks the birth of Hispanic heritage and the beginning of Hispanic culture because it is the day Columbus landed in the New World It is unclear if President Ronald Reagan was aware of this when he declared Hispanic Heritage Month to be celebrated September through October References Schmidt Vento Relajo Joking BehaviorA form of joking behavior visible among Mexicans and Chicanos with close friends and family that creates solidarity within the group but that also allows humorous or satirical discussion of taboo topics that are of importance to the group Jorge Portillas essay on relajo is often cited as the fundamental study of this comic conduct found among the Mexican working class His analysis focuses on the dynamics of this joking behavior relajando and how the working poor utilize it to disrupt values imposed on them by the social classes in power or the dominant culture Mexicanos living in urban poor communities experience almost daily a breakdown in social relations In brief Portillas definition states In summary relajo can be defined as the suspension of seriousness that rejects a value maintained by a group of people This suspension of seriousness in the face of officially serious issues such as life and death permits an individual to feel free and detached Through verbal performances joking and narrating humorous anecdotes an individual can suspend elements of gravity snobbery or socially imposed acceptable conductIn Mexican social thought the role of relajo behavior is shown to be a criticism of the political corruption of the government but also a burlesque of the divisions of the social classes Cantinflas the Mexican actor was the great relajero of all time As a comic actor he was the premier artist of the relajo whereby in a single ludicrous narrative monologue he could inadvertently chastise the urban poor and champion the social needs of the upper classes thus highlighting the obvious disparities But his relajando behavior the social situations and entanglements he got into were also subversively configured to emphasize the extreme illegitimacy of the social structure His personality not only entertained but also fulfilled a seditious function taunting the excesses of the wealthy and the absurdities of a structured social systemRelajo can also describe a joking relationship a bantering back and forth which through the laughter relieves tension and disintegrates the cause of the tension of the moment But it is the breakdown of decorum the rejection of a social value that everyone knows is necessary yet proscribed that the relajo subverts The cultural consequence is that through this type of behavior one can become temporarily free from social constraints that in daily life cannot be rejected If one could find a phrase in English that encompasses the relajo concept it would be to put one over on a system or a situation Relajando or echando relajo joking can be lighthearted joking around or can be heavy in a serious way about a grave topicFarr has studied the joking behavior of Mexican women in Chicago and found that through echando relajo married and young single women find relief from their gender roles and the social propriety imposed by their husbands parents and the Mexican culture Laughter created by farcical comportment or by satire creates an opposition to the prescribed value and to the seriousness of it Portilla calls the shared laughing una burla colectiva a collective joke and states that collective laughter facilitates the collective negacin a la conducta requerida negation of required conduct Relajo can overturn values or what is assumed to be valued El Teatro Campesino the Farmworkers Theater practiced the art of el relajo in the execution of its actos dramas and in the social protest messages propagated through satire and laughterSee also El Teatro CampesinoReferences Barriga BroylesGonzalez Farr Fregoso Portilla Religious Folk ArtThe creation of folk art is an unconscious aesthetic expression of community social and cultural values and religious folk art is the aesthetic reproduction of images and symbols for a religious or spiritual purpose The most obvious examples of religious folk art in Chicano culture are religious statues the santos saints retablos religious paintings exvotos and paintings of La Virgen de Guadalupe But there are many other shared religious experiences among Chicanos that result in the creation of religious folk art objects The descansos erected alongside rural roads where someone has died become works of art that convey spiritual sentiments Yard shrines that gradually swell with multicolored paper or plastic flowers plants statues of saints and rosaries are also religious art when lovingly tended by family members The same can be said for altars nacimientos nativity scenes and camposanto cemetery graves which are assembled with artistic care while always communicating a devout religious sentiment Bright coronas wreaths for cemetery grave markers with builtin nichos niches for saints and photos result in glorious displays of decorative art During the celebrations of Da de los Muertos Day of the Dead galleries exhibit beautiful altars and ofrendas offerings assembled by artists for community viewing but also for the spiritual sharing that results Religious icons carry great meaning in Chicano culture and always find their way into many folk art displays La Virgen de Guadalupe is tattooed on the backs or chests of hundreds of Chicanos and this too can be considered religious folk artSee also Altars Camposanto Descansos Da de los Muertos Nacimiento Retablos SantosReferences Awalt Boyd Espinosa Griffith Vidaurri Wilder Religious Folk PracticesFolk rituals customs and traditions based on religious or spiritual beliefs and on the ceremonial disciplines of the Catholic Church In Mexico and in small southwestern communities the church was often located in the center of town and the soul and rhythm of the people were synchronized with the liturgical seasons of the Church Processions fiestas blessings home prayers velorios wakes and religious societies were integrated into daily life The rural nature of many Mexicano communities meant that often a priest or official church clergy was absent so popular religiosity or folk religious practices developed among the strong spiritual people Some neighborhoods had rezadores or rezadoras spiritual leaders who led the community in prayer for funerals saints day celebrations and whenever the priest was unavailable The home shrine or altarcito little altar in many homes took the place of a house of worship Margaret Clarks study of the Mexican community in San Jose California in the s found that over percent of the homes had altarcitosThe American Roman Catholic Church was not always receptive to Mexican or Hispanic Catholicism In many communities the church clergy openly discriminated against Mexicans In Emporia Kansas the basement of the Sacred Heart Church was renovated and Mass was said for Mexicans two Sundays of each month Beeson Adams and King xix The lack of hospitality and the shortage of priests who spoke Spanish kept many Mexicanos from participating in the American Catholic ChurchThis situation served to reinforce religious folk practices and rituals brought from Mexico many based on a syncretism of Indian religious beliefs and medieval Catholicism from the sixteenth century The strong spiritual faith in the power of particular saints was frowned upon by the American church and considered to be an exaggerated superstitious belief Dolan and Hinojosa Recent histories of Chicanos and the Catholic Church suggest that Mexicans were not dependent on a priestcentered religion and developed their own popular devotions performed without a priest Mexican American spirituality developed both private and public expressions Private spirituality which was practiced individually or within the family stressed sacramental and personal devotions while the public religious stressed processions fiestas symbols and symbolic action that displayed the beliefs of the Mexican Catholic to the rest of the community Dolan and Hinojosa Eventually every Chicano community had its own parish due usually to the commitment and work of one individual priest in the diocese There is probably a Virgen de Guadalupe parish in every single Mexican community in the United States In spite of the fact that in some regions there was hostility by church officials the importance of the Catholic Church in creating Chicano communities cannot be overemphasized It was the church that created an environment where people could speak Spanish celebrate religious social and political ceremonies cook the special foods of the holy days and holidays and of course pray together The experience of Chicanos in Kansas as described by Beeson Adams and King was repeated throughout the Southwest and Midwest The church remained the most powerful center and cohesive force in the Mexican American colony It was a religious and social haven in an alien often hostile environment In the church the immigrant could use his Spanish language wear traditional costume celebrate Mexican Independence Day with a fiesta and eat traditional food The church also perpetuated the separateness of the Mexican Americans and their Anglo neighbors Beeson Adams and King xxReligious celebrations for a saints day brought a community together and reinforced religious conviction and ethnic solidarity Throughout the Southwest fiestas for San Juan San Isidro San Francisco La Virgen de Guadalupe and many other favorite saints incorporated religious rituals and secular revelry When paying homage to a saint the church held Masses and processions early in the day picnics horse races corridas de gallos rooster games and dances were held later in the day and evening A communitys social calendar was based on the Catholic liturgical calendar which provided frequent occasions for religious and cultural celebrations Lent started with Ash Wednesday and the belief was that if one received ashes one would live to see the end of the year La Cuaresma Lent was and still is a time of sacrifice prayers Va Cruces stations of the cross every Friday special meatless foods and spiritual preparation for Semana Santa Holy Week Palm Sunday with the distribution of holy palms resulted in the palms being made into crosses and tacked over doorways to protect the family from illness or harm Good Friday included processions and in some communities the burning of Judas Sbado de Gloria Holy Saturday and the end of Lent was often celebrated with jubilation and a dance Easter Sunday celebrations and the customs of new clothes and Easter egg hunts were adopted by Mexican American communities later probably after World War IIOne of the most important religious celebrations is the fiesta for La Virgen de Guadalupe held on December It often includes a Maanitas dawn Mass and serenade with Mariachi music a procession through the streets and a dinner and dance During the Christmas season there are usually Las Posadas for nine nights and performances of Los Pastores Shepherds PlayMany religious practices and beliefs have survived in some families without anyone knowing the source of the custom For example there is a custom of kissing a parents hand after receiving Holy Communion Before this act is performed the communicant drinks exactly three swallows of water There are many beliefs creencias connected to Holy Week observances such as not working on Holy Thursday and not taking baths on Good Friday On el Da de San Juan St Johns Day on June there are also traditions about swimming and taking baths In some regions this day is referred to as el da de baar meaning the day to take a bath of some kind It could be jumping in a river lake or waterway or just being splashed with water The tradition is connected to the baptism of St John and throughout Mexico it is common to see water fights on this day with buckets of water thrown on friends and family The maintenance of a family altar and reciting the rosary every day lighting votive candles blessing the children every night the blessing of homes and yards and making promises mandas to particular saints are all folk practices passed on from generation to generation Believing in the benevolent power of the saints and developing a special relationship with one particular saint is still a common habit Mary Helen Ponce in her book Hoyt Street has some

to general health care practitioners Curanderas healers use herbs to heal but many families rely on their own traditional remedios passed down from generation to generation Family knowledge and use of remedios may involve the preparation of teas salves ointments and the use of herbs for basic health maintenance A person who specializes in the application of herbs for healing purposes is called a yerbero and a person considered to be a healer is called a curandera or curandero Some remedios are simple and basic such as drinking yerba buena mint tea for an upset stomach to very complicated ritual procedures only known to a trained curandera Many of the herbal remedies used in Chicano and Mexican homes today were introduced to New Spain by the Europeans and were ancient herbs used by the Greeks Egyptians and Arabs They brought many herbs not native to Mexico and the Southwest such as chamomile anise cinnamon coriander mint oregano rosemary garlic and orange blossomsThere are literally hundreds of medicinal herbs used by the people of northern Mexico and the US Southwest Several collections of herbs have been catalogued and are located at the University of Michigans Ethnobotanical

Mexico retablos date from the middle of the eighteenth century in New Mexico The retablo paintings were painted on either hide or wooden boards sometimes also on tin but usually pine wood smoothed over on one side The surface of the board was covered with gesso before the design was painted on it Most were painted with tempera using a gesso ground with bright colors but contemporary retablos are often painted on tin Some dyes and pigments were made from plants and earth whereas others were probably imported from Mexico Since the early twentieth century retablos have been produced in the same form as they are to the present dayThese retablos may be painted for a specific saint in gratitude for a favor granted or in praise of the powers of the saint For example Durand and Massey have compiled and written about the many retablos to the Virgen de San Juan de los Lagos in Mexico The paintings usually depict an event survived or celebrated an illness an operation imprisonment or having received a passport to the United States or they may depict a person praying to the saint A few sentences written on the retablo express the favor granted starting with the words Doy gracias or Doy infinitas gracias a la Santisima Virgen de San Juan de los Lagos I give thanks I give infinite thanks to the most holy Virgin of San Juan of the Lakes and the reason for the retablo is written out with the location and date added at the endAnother expression for this religious art is retablo exvoto a votive painting created in payment to a saint according to a vow The Latin term ex voto means from a vow so the exvoto is specifically created to complete a vow made to a particular saint Other retablos may be painted in gratitude for something gained or accomplished but not because a vow was made A retablo exvoto is a work of art a religious painting and also a historical document The painting depicts the favor or miracle that occurred the holy image or saint responsible for the miracle and a short text that describes what occurred including the location and date of the event The text describing the event may begin with Doy Gracias I give thanks and express a need to state the miraculous event and tell how at the moment of crisis me encomend a la Virgen I entrusted myself to the Virgin The text usually ends por eso dedico este retablo this is why I dedicate this retablo The retablo is then placed in a church or a shrine devoted to that particular saint The tradition of creating votive paintings goes back hundreds of years in Mexico and can be found along the USMexican border region and in the cities of the Southwest Many people immigrating from Mexico for instance have painted or commissioned a retablo in gratitude for surviving a disaster or an illness Art

the early s the wool was not dyed and was left in colors of brown and white It was called churro a kind of sheep wool because it came from the common sheep introduced by the Spaniards Later the wool was combined with natural dyed yarns of indigo This wool was woven on a narrow treadle loom The designs for the Rio Grande blankets are very distinct with indigodyed stripes and later were influenced by Saltillo sarape motifs that were introduced in the late s There was much borrowing and exchange of materials fibers and dyes between the Pueblo Indians and the Spanish in the textile weaves of New Mexico The Saltillo sarape motif has a large complex diamond in the central layout of the blanket and sometimes is surrounded by a scalloped border Rio Grande blankets from the late nineteenth century

types those of a religious nature those that were sung to children or are of a nursery rhyme nature and those about universal and emotional adult topics The subjects of the romance were not the doings of the common folk but rather of those in the higher classes or in military office Two very old romances still sung in the Southwest are La Delgadina which deals with incest and La Aparicin which

early Hispano cowboy and the antecedent of the Hollywood cowboy Horses and cattle were brought to New Spain by the Spaniards When Hernn Corts landed on the eastern shore of Mexico he had with him sixteen horses and at least three breeds of cattle Cattle breeding was a tradition hundreds of years old in Spain and Corts brought this tradition to Mexico and eventually to the Southwest The Spaniards introduced the system of el rancho with vaqueros being the workers who herded the cattle and conducting cattle drives Vaca means cow and a vaquero is one who works with cows The Spanish mission padres recognized this labor and conscripted mestizos mixedrace people Indians and Mexicans to take care of the cattle It was these individuals who developed the system equipment practices and traditions that have lasted these past few hundred years The Anglo cowboy learned everything about cattle from the vaqueroThe Mexican vaquero was a laborer a peon who was used by the missionaries to ride the horses and take care of the cattle So it was the culture of the vaquero that became the basis for the romantic cowboy of Hollywood The ensemble equipment and clothing of the vaquero evolved through the years as a combination of Spanish leather and regional indigenous fabrics He always wore a sombrero with a wide brim a leather chaqueta jacket tightfitting kneelength sotas breeches and botas leather leggings for protection The vaquero also wore iron spurs like those worn by the Conquistadores which are still worn to this day The various styles of saddles from the Moorish to the Spanish war saddle eventually changed when the vaqueros began making their own saddles more suitable for riding hard and for quick mounting and dismountingThe early vaqueros those of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were mestizos Indians Negroes and mulattos When Anglo Americans moved into Texas and bought enormous tracts of land they established huge ranches and hired Mexican vaqueros to work them They recruited and moved whole families from Mexico to work and live on their ranches The King and Kennedy ranches of east Texas are contemporary examples of this tradition and have many generations of Mexican vaqueros still living on their ranches A social historical study of the vaquero life on the King and Kennedy ranches from the early nineteenth century to the present has been written by Monday and ColleyThe vaquero from California also worked on very large ranches such as the Tejon ranch in the lower San Joaquin Valley This way of life has been memorialized in the work of Arnold Rojas who was a vaquero and has written about his life in California in the twentieth century Rojas makes a distinction between the cowboy the vaquero and the buckaroo The vaquero was originally Hispanic or Mexican or Indian and herded cattle in the Far West in the states of California Nevada Oregon Arizona Utah and Washington whereas the cowboys who herded cattle in the southern states were usually Negro or Anglo The vaquero or buckaroo is a westerner and the cowboy is a southerner The definition is a territorial one with the cowboy working east of the Rockies and the vaquero west of the Rockies It is this difference that Rojas writes about in his threevolume memoir of the California vaquero Anglos coined the word buckaroo meaning vaquero because they disliked the word cowboy and did not want to call themselves by that name Somehow when they pronounced vaquero it came out of their mouths as buckaroo The California Indians were trained by the Spanish missionaries to herd cattle and they were the primary vaqueros until the mids Mexicans from Sonora took over as vaqueros when they started migrating into California in the nineteenth century The style of horse riding instituted by the Spaniards was called la jinete a term that relates to the equipment used in riding It not only includes the bits spurs and the saddles but also the length of the stirrups how the reins are held and the amount of pressure of the knees on the horse Rojas was born in California as was his mother who as a child had a pleasant encounter with the bandit Tiburcio Vsquez He spent his

trial in the San Jose jail Vsquez appealed for funds for his defense Thousands of people came to visit him in jail bringing flowers food and other gifts With the funds raised he was able to hire two wellqualified lawyers Even so he was found guilty by a jury and sentenced to death He was publicly hanged on March in San Jose CaliforniaThere are many stories recounting the legendary exploits of

a party or fandango a woman hid him under her great hooped dress where he crouched silently until the constable gave up his search of the premises Another anecdote of narrow escape tells the tale of

chosen and all of the girls are caught In some versions the girls carry ribbons each of a different color Scholars who have analyzed the game point to the socialization of gender roles for little

known as Nuestra Seora de Guadalupe she is the Virgin Mary who appeared to Juan Diego a Mexican Christian Indian on December Historical documents verify the story of her apparitions She identified herself as the Virgin Mary the Mother of God and speaking in Nahuatl she asked Juan Diego to go to the Spanish bishop and ask that a temple be built there where she appeared the mount of Tepeyac To Juan Diego she was a beautiful woman who spoke his language so after much difficulty he sought to speak to the bishop but his story was not heard and he was asked to return another day The beautiful woman appeared to Juan Diego a second time and he was asked to seek the bishops audience again On the second try Juan Diego saw the bishop his story was heard and questioned but was not believed The bishop wanted a sign from the Great Lady so that he would know it was really she who was sending Juan Diego Diego intended to go back to Tepeyac and inform the beautiful woman but when he returned home he found that his uncle Juan Bernardino was extremely ill The next morning on December as he walked to Tlatelolco to call a priest to come to his uncles side the beautiful woman came to him a third time asking what was wrong Diego told her of his sick uncle and of the request from the bishop She told him his uncle was now well and would not die and sent him to the top of a hill to cut fresh flowers that he was to take to the bishop as proof of her existence Diego followed her instructions and at the top of the hill he found beautiful roses of Castile still covered with dew He cut them and The Lady the Mother of God arranged them in his tilma cloak and sent him to the bishop with the proof requested When Diego unfolded his tilma in front of the bishop the roses fell to the floor and there on the tilma was an image of the Virgin Mary Now the Spanish bishop believed and as the beautiful woman requested a church was built right on the mount of Tepeyac The tilma with the image of the Virgin Mary still hangs in the temple called Guadalupe The name that the beautiful Lady gave herself was Tlecuauhtlacupeuh but to the Spaniards it sounded like Guadalupe which they instantly recognized as Our Lady of Guadalupe from Estremadura Spain But the Aztecs understood that in the Nahuatl language the name Tlecuauhtlacupeuh meant la que viene volando de la luz como el guila de fuego she who comes flying from the region of light like an eagle of fireTonantzin was an Aztec goddess literally called Our Holy Mother also known as Tonan Guadalupe appeared at what was once the temple of Tonantzin at the mount of Tepeyac Even today in Mexico La Virgen Mara is often called Tonantzin The acceptance of La Virgen de Guadalupe by the indigenous population of Mexico was the beginning of Mexican Christianity and the conversion of the Aztecs to Catholicism Guadalupe became the symbol of Indian Catholicism different from the European Catholicism of the Spaniards As the Aztecs adapted the Catholic religion to their indigenous beliefs they created a religion that met their own needs and own way of life She was declared the Patroness of the Mexican Nation in and in Pope Benedict XIV canonized Guadalupe as an official saint She was crowned Queen of Mexico in showing how strong a symbol of Mexican nationalism she had become Today she continues as the countrys strongest symbol of Mexican identity The cathedral built in her honor can no longer be used because of structural damage but a new one was built in the early s Masses are held every hour of the day and the church is constantly filled to capacityFaith in La Virgen de Guadalupe is one of the strongest convictions in Mexican and Chicano culture Guadalupe has become a powerful cultural image Her appearance was crucial in restoring dignity and humanity to a conquered people Eric Wolf refers to Guadalupe as a master symbol a symbol which seems to enshrine the major hopes and aspirations of an entire society She is the mother of the mestizo race La Raza The People and a political symbol for the oppressed and powerless She is affectionately referred to as La Morenita Virgencita Lupita Madrecita Madre de Dios and Nuestra Seora Virgil Elizondo a Chicano theologian states Guadalupe is the key to understanding the Christianity of the New World and the Christian consciousness of the Mexicans and the Mexican Americans of the United States Belief in her power as a mediator for the oppressed has prompted faithful followers to carry her image into battle for over years Father Hidalgo during the Mexican War of Independence Emiliano Zapata during the Mexican Revolution and Csar Chvez during his battle for farmworkers rights against California agribusiness all carried the emblem of La Virgen de Guadalupe The image of Guadalupe provides support for those who believe in her divine power as the deliverer from oppressionEl Teatro Campesino has created a cultural piece titled La Virgen de Tepeyac The Virgin of Tepeyac For many years now it has been performed during the early part of December in the mission church of San Juan Bautista California It has become a Bay Area Christmas tradition to make the twohour journey to the small mission town to experience the miracle of Guadalupe although all Mexican American churches throughout the United States organize elaborate church ceremonies for December the day of her appearance so there are literally hundreds of celebrations one can choose from to commemorate the dayContemporary Chicanas continuously look toward Guadalupe and reevaluate her influence in their mothers and grandmothers lives and in their own lives Although she is the preeminent representation of womanhood she has become an icon for womens subjugation and oppression In the s the artist Yolanda Lopez created a memorable image of working mothers by painting a garment worker at a sewing machine within the recognizable blue shield background that is easily acknowledged as the emblem of La Virgen de Guadalupe In New Mexico a young Chicana created a dance theater piece titled Apariciones de la Madre which incorporated modern ideas of women into the traditional images of the Aztec GuadalupeChicano muralists have painted images of Guadalupe in her traditional Aztec setting on barrio walls since the late s and often other cultural symbols such as a lowrider car are added to emphasize the Chicano experience La Virgen de Guadalupe is revered religiously candles are lit for her flowers are left at the church for her and yet she is very much a part of popular culture Her image is found on Tshirts key rings lowrider car hoods and tattooed across adult male chests Her face and form are frequently deciphered on tortillas shadows on walls and the trunks of trees When such an image is found thousands of people whether in Mexico or the United States flock to see and pray before the image The influence of Guadalupe is as

ChanesWedding CustomsChicano wedding rituals vary from state to state in the Southwest and the Midwest often incorporating emerging American customs but there are still common traditions that originate with Catholicism and the Spanish heritage that are shared from community to community The Spanish word for a wedding is boda meaning nuptials and often Chicanos will call a wedding celebration La Boda The southwestern region with the most researched and documented wedding customs is New Mexico because the descendents of the early Hispanos have been conscious of describing and writing down their traditions For instance Fabiola Cabeza de Baca Cleofas Jaramillo and Nina Otero all wrote about the weddings of northern New Mexico In her book The Good Life Fabiola Cabeza de Baca has a brief chapter on wedding traditions including recipes and a detailed description of the preparation of the foodWhen a couple married three main ceremonies took place These were initiated after the groom and his family had asked the girls family for her hand in marriage If the girl or her family refused the offer she would send a letter to her suitor with her negative response This was termed as giving calabazas squash or pumpkin and was a great insult to the wooer Of the ceremonies first there was el da del prendorio day of the engagement when the bride and groom came together publicly for the first time A great celebration would take place usually in the home of the bride with food drinks and music This festivity would be equivalent to an engagement party The day of the wedding was called el da del casorio and could last from two to three days The upper classes held lavish wedding ceremonies that would last for days with lots of music and food for their many guests the poorer folks also followed many of the same traditions although in a more modest fashion It was the tradition that the bridegrooms family hosted the celebration after the church service There was always an orchestra that played while the guests ate and a big dance on the eve of the wedding day After the dance or at the conclusion of the feast there was the entrega de novios delivery of the wedding couple when the wedding couple was formally returned to their parents and placed under their guidance Songs from this ritual were collected by Juan Rael and reveal the solemnity of the ceremonyThe Hispano folklore does not specify the actual religious sacramental rituals but more recent publications do describe church ceremonies that are still observed today In very traditional weddings the arras thirteen coins or pieces of silver are given by the groom to his bride as a symbol of security After the wedding vows are stated during the Mass a lazo a cord with two connected loops is draped over the couple to symbolize the union of bride and groom Just before the couple leaves the church the bride or sometimes a designated child will pay tribute to La Virgen de Guadalupe by placing flowers at the foot of her statue or picture There are always lots of padrinos godfathers and madrinas godmothers bridegrooms and bridesmaids and of course Mariachi musicFrances Toors

BrujeraWith His Pistol in His HandThe title of a book by the eminent professor Amrico Paredes that has become a classic in American folklore and Chicano studies With His Pistol in His Hand A Border Ballad and Its Hero published in by the University of Texas Press is not only one of the most important academic works on the history of the Chicano but it is also respected as major scholarship in the field of folklore studies and specifically on the genre of the ballad It is a study of a border ballad El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez which looks at the history of the TexasMexican border and the life of Gregorio Cortez and presents an analysis of the man as a ballad hero As stated by Paredes himself in the introduction It is an account of the life of a man of the way that songs and legends grew up about his name and of the people who produced the songs the legends and the man It was in this work that Paredes proposed his theory of the production of Chicano folklore and especially the border ballad as a result of a process of border conflict generated by the invasion of Anglo culture and values into the Texas region in the early nineteenth century The balladry of the Rio Grande border was one of resistance against outside encroachment There was an inner need for the people to compose ballads that sang of the deeds of a man standing up for his rights who in the process is transformed into a hero Often the man is nonviolent but is coerced through persecution or abuse into killing his enemy often a Texas Ranger and must escape to the border His defeat is assured often he is killed or captured But whatever his fate he has stood up for his right When the book was published it caused quite a stir in Texas because of its negative portrayal of the Texas Rangers The chief editor at the University of Texas Press asked Paredes to delete his critical references to Walter Prescott Webb J Frank Dobie and the Texas Rangers The book was eventually published in spite of his refusal to make any changes The timing of its publication was crucial in for its powerful influence on Chicano students and intellectuals since it came out just before the start of the Chicano movement of the s Its intellectual and political impact on a whole generation of Chicano scholars cannot be overstated Almost all publications on Chicanos and Mexicanos up to that date had been written by Anglo American sociologists or anthropologists and the few published Hispano scholars such as Aurelio Espinosa and Arthur Campa were only known within a narrow circle of folklore specialists Gregorio Cortez the border hero and Amrico Paredes the scholar hero both became figures that young Chicano students could respect and emulateSee also El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez Corridos

commemorate many holidays such as Halloween Da de los Muertos Day of the Dead Cinco de Mayo Fifth of May and even the Fourth of July A yard shrine may be a permanent display in the form of a small chapel a nicho niche or a gruta grotto or shrine set up in the front yard of a home It may contain one or more holy images of saints or the Virgin Mary especially La Virgen de Guadalupe flowers or potted plants colorful garlands and votive candles These shrines are often just called nichos and the word shrine is not even mentioned During special holidays such as Christmas or on a saints feast day a shrine may be lighted up for the community to share It is a common practice to make the sign of the cross or recite a short prayer when walking past a religious yard shrineIn many families the shrine is erected as the result of a promesa or manda promise or vow made to a particular saint or in memory of a family member who has died A yard shrine whether called a nicho or a gruta can be decorated in various ways There are always plants and flowers sometimes seashells decorate the outside if it is constructed of cement and the decorations will reflect the holiday season of the year At Christmas there may be lights tinsel and poinsettias During Lent there may be lilies and pastel paper chains Yard shrines demonstrate that religion is integrated into the life of a family and they are considered to be sacred sites for prayer and devotion There is no division between the public life and the religious and devotional life of a Chicano family A yard shrine is a public exhibition of a familys religion and their devotion to a particular saint as well as a display of an artistic sensibility that emerges unconsciously from the familys beliefsA related form of yard folk art not necessarily religious is the yard asamblea assemblage A wellknown man in Los Angeles referred to as El Hombre de las Banderas The Man of the Flags created spectacular scenes up until his death in Art

for garden is jardn many Chicano families favor the term yard while referring to their gardens pronouncing it in Spanish as yarda Although yarda appears to be a pochismo Chicano slang it can be found in Cassells Spanish Dictionary The layout and organizational aesthetics of Chicano yardas are unique enough that folklorists and cultural geographers have written about them Many yardas can aesthetically constitute yard art even though it does not appear that this is the intent of the creator Besides planting shrubs flowers and sometimes grass the gardener will bring into play the creativity that goes into decorating a yard unconsciously with the result being a folk art display Invariably a yard will contain many potted flowers arranged in a patterned manner The central focus of many yards is often a devotional shrine set up in memory of a family member with a nicho housing a saint or Madonna and the design of the yards plants and flowers is laid out in reference to the shrine Some yardas may not have planted grass but instead hardpacked dirt that is kept free of weeds swept frequently and kept prepared for family gatherings But trees preferably fruit trees abound to make shade for family gatherings and outdoor cookingA common practice among many workingclass Mexican Americans is to recycle as much as possible although the concept that recycling is an environmentally correct thing to do is not always known Common recycled objects that can be found in yards are tables kitchen pots painted tin cans and car tires used as planters Tires are cut across the width making two containers opened up and cut with a scalloped design around the edges After being painted and filled with flowers and plants these plant containers do not even resemble their original form Recycled tire planters can line a driveway or establish the boundaries of a large yard The practice of reusing objects that have lost their original purpose such as kitchen pitchers and pots is a means of keeping something familiar something associated with a memory alive and finding a new use for it This practice probably originates from poverty but the historical result has been that it creates its own aesthetic in adding adornment to ones home and life These yardscapes as theyve come to be called are composed of bits and pieces of ones personal life and as such can add visual charm and historical value to a home A familys religious and cultural values as well as the special identity of being Mexican American can be found in yardasSee also Folk Art Nichos Yard

Chicano culture this style of dress is primarily associated with the pachucos of the s The fashion at that time was to wear very baggy pants with pegged legs long jackets with high and sharp shoulder pads thicksoled shoes and long watch chains dangling from the belt An addition to the whole style common to Chicanos was a particular haircut long with a ducktail and a widebrimmed hatThe word zoot was known within the urban jazz culture of Harlem and it meant something either exaggerated in performance or in style Many African Americans wore an extravagant style of clothing the baggy pegged pants and jackets with padded shoulders that later became known as the zoot suit In the novel Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison he describes the zootsuiters style walking slowly their shoulders swaying their legs swinging from their hips in trousers that ballooned upward from cuffs fitting snug about their ankles their coats long and hiptight with shoulders far too broad to be those of natural western men In the latenight jazz scenes of Harlem this style was a killerdiller coat with a drapeshape reatpleats and shoulders padded like a lunatics cell Tyler makes the point that the zoot suit was an extremely symbolic costume which gave the wearer the look of a child in adult clothing The broad square shoulders gave a macho look to the youth and the fingertipped coat was made for fun and leisure The long baggy pants were made for dancing especially the jitterbug and the wide Panama hats were another sign of adulthood The business of fun dancing and dating were the key characteristics displayed by ZootSuiters It was an escape from drudgery and futile labor to the bliss of freewheeling movement in the city among youths in the new youth culture Tyler Prominent black entertainers wore the zoot suit such as Cab Calloway Sammy Davis Jr and Duke Ellington Ellington performed at the Orpheum in Los Angeles in and with a musical called Jump for Joy in which the performers wore zoot suits also known as Gone with the Wind suits after the style worn by Clark Gable in the movie by the same nameEven though the zoot suit was worn by the young men of several different races and ethnicities it is primarily identified with the pachucos of Los Angeles Pachucos were mostly secondgeneration Mexicans the sons of migrant laborers and workingclass immigrants Pachucos created their own subculture an arrogant style of dressing a bilingual secret argot and for some individuals membership in petty criminal gangs The zoot suit became a symbolic disguise that identified the zootsuiter as neither a Mexican nor an American It was not a bicultural or binational position but rather a position between cultures a hanging in space position The overly confident slow swagger of the pachuco today exemplified by the cholo made it appear in fact as if the zootsuiter were walking on airDuring the summer of the attention of the whole country was on Los Angeles when gangs of sailors and zootsuiters battled with each other in the streets of the city It is unclear if this was a race riot or a riot of patriotic sailors who attacked beat and stripped young Mexican Americans whom they perceived to be unpatriotic zootsuiters Between the third and thirteenth of June zootsuiters were open targets Much has been written about these riots from both literary and historical perspectivesDuring the late s the zoot suit received wide recognition and popularity with the production of a successful play by Luis Valdez In a film by the same name Zoot Suit was produced and

FiestaReferences Cohen Grimes Weigle and White In the Western experience with evil we choose repeatedly to put our faith in law and the legal culture to redeem ourselves from sin Over and over again we find states indulging in total war terror genocide and the mass killing of their own people and then turning to the legal culture in the hope that they can atone for the iniquity and live once again as a civilized nation This viewthat the law shall make us cleanshould give us pause Faith in the law has not been an unqualified virtue in the Christian West One might expect individuals influenced by Jesuss Sermon on the Mount to turn first to love and charity as the means of atonement But nationsorganized organic societiesmust take a different path A nation must proceed collectively to find redemptionI write in this chapter of religious ideas and their value in understanding our legal experience This admittedly is an unusual take in our rigorously secular academic world The American university world has distanced itself from the sensibilities of ordinary Americans who take the Bible seriously as a source of wisdom and who live their lives with devotion to values of faith and redemption In this interpretation of law as the path to national redemption I seek to find a middle way between Jewish and Christian thinking There is no doubt that the nations whose struggles I describeFrance Germany and the United Statesthink of themselves as Christian nations Yet the very idea of redemption of the entire nation through law resonates more with the older tradition of the Jewish national mission under the Torah revealed at Mount Sinai My account seeks to unite the divergent strains of all religions that trace their roots to the original idea in Exodus of a nation living under God and under lawTo understand the phenomenon of communal redemption we must turn to the Bible as our source The model of the Hebrews deliverance from servitude and their ensuing acceptance of Gods law at Mount Sinai have repeatedly appealed to dominant powers of the West and often to opposite sides of the same conflict In the rhetoric of the abolitionists slavery in the United States made the country into a House of Bondage Both blacks and whites identified with the same story of liberation from this domain of oppression Nat Turner thought he was recreating the biblical story when he led a slave revolt in The slaves whom Harriet Tubman led to freedom in the North called her Moses Abraham Lincoln readily saw himself in the image of Moses leading his people out of bondage into the realm of freedomThe Hebrews fled Egypt in order eventually to accept the law revealed at Mount Sinai delivery from servitude requires more than violent revolt The message of Exodus is not simply liberation from slavery but the domesticating of violent sensibilities under the rule of law Jews celebrate this submission to Gods law in the holiday of Shevuot which commemorates the revelation of the Torah at Mount Sinai and is celebrated fifty days after the night of the Exodus Christians have reinterpreted this event as the descent of the Holy Spirit celebrated in the analogous spring holiday of PentecostThe idea that freedom exists only under law is often understood as a Central European or German approach to the individual in society Americans tend to subscribe rather to the myth of a Lockian state of nature where individuals exist prior to the organization of society under a social contract The Declaration of Independence relies heavily on the principle that the consent of the governed is indispensable to the legitimacy of government Yet in actual American practice the lawparticularly constitutional lawserves the same function of sanctifying the social order as it does in the European experience Before turning to the details of the American appeal to law after the surrender at Appomattox Courthouse in April let us examine first two significant European efforts to domesticate tendencies toward violence under the rule of lawRedemption by Law in France and GermanyThink first about the way in which the French sought repose from postrevolutionary terror in their Code civil The country passed through fifteen years of regicide terror and mass executions Amidst voices clamoring for stability and security Napoleon staged his coup dtat in late High on his agenda was revamping the legal system In he charged a group of lawyers with the task of drafting a new civil code in language accessible to ordinary people The committee produced the elegant Code civil now a mainstay of French culture and a model for civil codification all over the world The language is so refined that the novelist Henri Stendhal reportedly reviewed the style of ten code provisions every night before retiring Today when the Francophones in Quebec preach the distinctiveness of their culture they never fail to mention their Code civil modeled after Napoleons effort to use the law as the means of restoring civilized order to FranceThe Code civil has proved to be remarkably durable in French culture Constitutions have come and gone and the French have endured recurrent changes of regime including communes dictatorships and five distinct republics Yet through all this the civil code has survived It is the cultural monument that unites the French across historyIn its substantive content the Code civil is strongly identified with the achievements of the Revolution against the ancien regime The code sweeps away the vestiges of feudal influence in the law of property and in the law of evidence and proclaims a liberal legal order The end of feudalism in the law of property meant that a single concept of ownership would replace the ancient system of embedded estates The implication was that all land would be freely alienable without being burdened by the residual control of lords higher in the feudal chain The code thus provides the legal foundation for a market economy The end of feudalism in the field of evidence means that the testimony of a nobleman is no longer worth more than the oath of a peasant Thus the code institutionalizes the galit of all citizens as promised in the slogan of the RevolutionStanding for these liberal values incorporating the messages of revolution and surviving all changes of political regimes the Code civil functions like a constitution for the French It is the bedrock of the legal culture In their code the French have found an enduring symbol of the rule of law a conviction that the language concepts and rules of the legal order can hold back the impulses toward violence terror and reciprocal vengeance Faith in the code has redeemed the nation from the nightmare of the guillotineThe metaphor of redemption should not pass our lips lightly In its original meaning it has legal connotations something on loan gets returned to its owner The older Jewish law of homicide relied on the metaphor of the Goel haDam the redeemer of blood to refer to the victims nextofkin who under certain circumstances could pursue the murderer and kill him David Daube has interpreted this practice against the background assumption that at the time of a natural death the life forcesymbolized by bloodalways returns to God If the death occurs at the hand of another the manslayer unnaturally acquires control over the victims blood The Goel haDam the redeemerofblood executes the manslayer in order to release the victims blood thus enabling it to return to its divine source The notion that our life force belongs to God accounts for the views of virtually all secular liberal systems that no one can validly consent to his or her own killing at the hand of anotherIt is tempting to extend this idea and to think of all humanity as enjoying a temporary privilege of life on earth God somehow will redeem all of us at the end of history In fact the Jewish view as it has evolved and matured seems to have avoided this universalization of the idea that individual life stems from God As the idea developed the agent of redemption would be the Messiah who would bring a reign of peace and harmony to life on earth The redemption occurs in life as we know it Orthodox Jewish culture takes the observance of Gods commandments living under the rule of revealed law as interpreted by the rabbis as the way to hasten the Messiahs reign of harmony and order The law then becomes the path toward redemption Until the Prince of Peace comes to fulfill the law or until the Apocalypse at the end of days the secular law of the nation is the only means we have to work toward the perfection of life on earthThe place of blood in the religious tradition of redemption proves to be subtle and problematic There are some strains in the Jewish tradition that link the letting of blood with returning the soul to God The redeemer of blood reminds us of that connection as does the popular view that the founding of Israel stood in some kind of organic relationship with the Holocaust The connection between blood and salvation becomes much stronger however in the Christian interpretation of its Jewish legacy The theme of blood spilling from the body becomes powerful in the crucifixion and reaches its apotheosis in the faith that a great battle an Apocalypse must precede the Second Coming of the Messiah The spilling of blood in a great battle is understood instinctively as the suffering that must precede redemption As John Brown was led to the gallows on the eve of the Civil War having unsuccessfully sought to stimulate a slave revolt he handed one of his guards a note I John Brown am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged away but with bloodBut blood alone does not save a nation from its sins The argument here is that indulgence in evilslavery mass killing persecutionmust first issue in the suffering of the people To overcome their sense of selfinflicted brutality they turn to the law as the path of secular redemption They search for stability after having succumbed to their baser instincts The law provides a source of hope that the civil order can resist the recurrent slippage into violence and brutality The important point is that the rule of lawnot charity not prayer not animal sacrificeshould provide the means of secular redemptionFor nations as a whole to seek redemption they must find a discipline that operates on them as a group as a community Individual acts of devotion will not suffice Needed is the discipline represented by the lawthe expression of communal cooperation par excellence The compromises and obligations of life under the law hardly makes sense to individuals standing alone preoccupied by their own values and their own needs The law redeems not the individual but the community or the nation as a wholeThis view of the relationship between law and redemption finds expression in the Hebrew Bible the Old Testament It continues to inspire the lawbased thinking of Judaism Islam the Catholic Church and some Protestant theologians The law given at Sinai the law embedded in the covenant is not the expression of individual aspiration but only of collective obligation Seeking redemption or salvation through the church or through faith provides a way of cleansing ourselves of sin and as it were perfecting our individual creationLegal cultures too must seek to perfect themselves They cannot exist simply as the product of will When legal cultures lose sight of their natural end of bringing a reign of justice and harmony to human affairs they decline into corruption and the arbitrariness of power The German philosopher Gustav Radbruch defined the ideal of Law as the practice of establishing rules in the pursuit of justice Communal life seeks through law to perfect itself This secular idea parallels the eschatological aim of perfecting the creation of the world under Gods reignSeeking redemption under the law cannot simply be a desire for ones parochial values to triumph in the courts It matters which values are in play And it matters how these values are debated in the legal culture Debate about legal issues must be open and robust and the very process of legal argument must communicate respect for the opposition At the end of a legal argument both sides must have the sense that they have been listened to and that the dignity of the losing party is affirmed in the process of decision Here as well we have much to learn from the model provided by the Jewish tradition of Talmudic debate When a rabbi questioned how two of the greatest sages Rabbis Hillel and Shammai could persistently disagree the response was These and these are the words of the living God Although Rabbi Hillels views are generally followed Rabbi Shammai is treated in defeat with the greatest respectIt is not surprising that when the established authoritys respect for the political opposition is debased the legal culture invariably suffers This is most noticeably clear in dictatorial societies where legal debate is reduced to little more than efforts to placate the powers that be Although the National Socialists purported to rely on legal forms and administrative regularity their contempt for free and mutually respectful discourse led to a corruption of the legal culture The Nazis conception of law fluctuated between two unpalatable extremes Sometimes the slogan was that law was what Hitler wanted and commanded Recht is das was der Fhrer will At other times utility to the German people was the ultimate source of legitimacy Recht is das was dem Volke nutzt The National Socialist Partys manipulation of these slogans and their observance of legal forms served only to bring the culture to a deeper level of corruptionIt is an extraordinary feature of postwar German culture that a new generation of jurists managed to save to redeem their concept of law from its racist and Nazi associations In the wake of their unforgettable crimes against humanity the West Germans too sought redemption in the rule of law in the Rechtsstaat that they have cultivated along with economic prosperity Living by the law and seeking justice within the law redeems the humanistic side of German culture It has suppressed the romantic will to break all restraints for the sake of glory in powerThe Germans too have a civil code that has united them since through the transitions from Bismarck to Weimar to the Third Reich to the present Yet under the National Socialists the code which contains the provisions on family law became tainted with notions of racial purity Jews and Aryans could not marry Of course this stain disappeared in the postwar reform but the memory remains of a corrupted civil code Not surprisingly then Germans have sought redemption by promoting both a new constitution enacted in and the rule of law in a united Europe More than any country seeking redemption under law the Germans identified their new constitution the Grundgesetz as the focal point of state authority The sanctity of the constitutionand not the personal head of statebecame the interest protected under the reformed law of treason When West Germans felt their infant postwar republic endangered by Communist subversion they appointed an agency to protect the integrity of the government The announced aim of the agency was to protect the constitution VerfassungsschutzThe preamble of this charter called the Basic Law Grundgesetz repeatedly reminds Germans of the imperative to atone for the sins of the pastConscious of its responsibility before God and humanity possessed of the will to serve the peace of the world as an equal member of a United Europe the German nation Volk commits itself by virtue of its inherent constitutionmaking authority to the following Basic LawNo other constitution so far as I know stresses its sense of responsibility and declares as one of its primary purposes to serve the peace of the world These gestures recall the descent of the German nation into the evils of aggressive war and crimes against humanityThe first article of the Basic Law invokes the humanistic Kantian underpinnings of German culture Human dignity is inviolable All state power is obligated to protect it and respect it This provision provides the backdrop for interpreting all the basic rights guaranteed under the constitution The protection of human dignity is the fundamental value suffusing the entire legal order The highest virtue of the postwar German constitutional order then was precisely the greatest casualty of the Nazi regime The path to redemption lay in reclaiming the liberal and humanistic values most systematically violated in their darkest hour The point is carried forward in the second article Everyone has the right to flourishing of his or her personality Everyone has the right to lifeThese are provisions that enabled Germans to redefine their identities They would no longer be the people devoted to the Volk above all They would become the nation of human dignity that served the cause of human flourishing and the sanctity of human life For the postwar Germans then the law and particularly the Basic Law became the means for suppressing evil impulses and returning to the promises of an earlier national self This is what redemption means in a secular legal worldThe redemptive impulse leads national courts to place an emphasis on values that resonate against past sins The German Constitutional Court has made a number of controversial decisions that make sense primarily as efforts to resolve the burden of memory The court decided to uphold a law abolishing the twentyyear statute of limitations for concentration camp murders It invoked the constitutional right to life to strike down a liberal abortion law that permitted abortion on demand in the first trimester And more recently the court rejected an East German statutory justification for border guards who shot at their own citizens trying to flee the country for the West All of these decisions brought to the fore fundamental values of protecting life and punishing those with contempt for life Yet the particular German emphasis on these values would probably not appeal in the same measure to other European courtsThe Germans themselves have coined a unique hardtotranslate phrase to describe the controversies that have driven their system of justice for the last fifty years They call it Bewltigung der Vergangenheitovercoming or coming to grips with the past Settling accounts with the past provides a critical perspective on the process of redemption from evil We cannot avoid the past for we are all prisoners of it In real life we cannot reenact the forty years of wandering in the desert that the Hebrews had to endure before they could shake off their ingrained ways and a new generation could seek redemption under the law In the world of practical politics we must act now and criminal punishment often provides the mechanism for distancing ourselves from the past so that we can start anewCivil War as the Path to RedemptionAs France and Germany had their experiences of seeking redemption after reigns of terror Americans too indulged in the mammoth bloodletting on the killing fields of the Civil War When Lincoln sought to resupply Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor and General Beauregard chose in response to fire on the federal fort the longsimmering feud between North and South bled into brothers killing each other at close range They fired their canons on Fort Sumter they fixed their bayonets at Little Round Top they lobbed shells onto Vicksburg until troops could seize the forts reigning over the Mississippi they burned down Atlanta and under William Tecumseh Sherman they scorched the earth on their march to the sea The blue and the gray fell everywhere And they were not sure why They only had abstract ideas in their headssome died for the Union others for their separate nation Over six hundred thousand lives stained the ground more than all the former and subsequent American wars put togetherHaving barely won reelection midway in this slaughter Abraham Lincoln could only say of the reign of terror Woe unto the world because of offences We had descended into the bloodiest war of our history without clear purposes or any understanding of how it might end For it must needs be that offences come but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh The selfinflicted pogrom is seen as a woe and a scourge inflicted for the terrible offence of slavery Lincolns second inaugural address prayed for redemption The nation had bled its sins onto its own soil and craved a rebirth of American civilizationThe survivors turned to law One year into the war after a string of Union defeats Lincoln learned that the old Union could not possibly survive A new one had to be embraced And the new Union would have to be based on a new constitutional order A nation of free Americans including emancipated slaves would bear responsibility for rebuilding the United States on the basis of a constitution acceptable to all Formally speaking the original charter of would remain in place but it would be so radically transformed that it would stand to the ancien United States as the Code civil related to the French feudal order or as any redeemed legal culture compares to the brutality and chaos that precedes itThe American hope for a new beginning lay in the Reconstruction Amendmentsthe Thirteenth Fourteenth and Fifteenthall enacted in quest of a new definition of freedom and equality under the law The first clause of the Fourteenth Amendment specified who would be a member of the new polity All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United States With a single stroke the new constitution erased the effects of one of the worst blemishes in American constitutional historythe Dred Scott decision of which held that persons of African descent could never become citizens of the United States In the new United States there would be no discrimination based on blood The only question that mattered was whether you were born within the polity and whether you were therefore likely to come to maturity with the language and consciousness of American cultureWith just boundaries of the new nationstate properly defined the highest order of business was to define the basic rights of its citizens The structure of these rights follows the pattern established in the Declaration of Independence life liberty and the pursuit of happiness Yet there was a new recognition that the inalienable rights of all Americans were now to be realized not in the state of nature but under the rule of law The naturalistic pursuit of happiness celebrated in the Declaration gives way to the quintessential creature of the laws definitionproperty Yet the basic rights of life liberty and property are inalienable without being absolute The ideal must be adapted to the practical demands of competing claims The legal system would have to decide when individuals could fairly be deprived of liberty or property or even of life thus the coining of the famous and influential clause of the American Constitution namely that no State shall deprive any person of life liberty or Property without due Process of law The law would define the content and the limits of the inalienable rights celebrated in the Declaration of IndependenceAlso for the first time the law would define duties incumbent on the states The individual state governments must not only guarantee due process for all persons within their jurisdiction they must also secure the equal protection of the laws for all to whom their power extends True the original Constitution places some limits on the legislative competence of the states They must defer to the supremacy of federal law and recognize the privileges and immunities of the citizens of all other states And there were specific restrictions They could not enact bills of attainder expost facto laws or any law impairing the obligation of contracts In the postbellum constitutional order however the states acquired a pervasive duty to treat their residentsthose subject to their jurisdictiondecentlyThis was a revolutionary change The states were no longer the autonomous sovereigns that they thought they were when they claimed the right of secession They were now in fact servants of their people Governments existed to guarantee due process and equal justice for all The local law was no longer simply a creature of the states The states themselves were enmeshed in the law and subordinate to itIn addition to embedding the states in the rule of law the new constitutional order embarked on an affirmative program to ensure equality among those citizens subject to the jurisdiction of the United States The heart of the new consensus is that the federal government victorious in warfare must continue its aggressive intervention in the lives of its citizens It must protect the weak against the risk that they would slip into states of subordination resembling the past from which they sought to escape According to the Thirteenth Amendment there could never again be relationships of slavery or involuntary servitude in the United States The federal government would have to be ever watchful to insure that this kind of slippage would never occur in the private relationships among citizens Furthermore under the equal protection clause the states must recognize and promote the equality of those subject to their jurisdiction To round out the commitment to equality according to the Fifteenth Amendment ratified in the states could no longer deny voting rights to citizens on the grounds of their race color or previous condition of servitudeThese objectives and guarantees are insufficient in themselves to create a constitution a framework of government One needs in addition a definition of legislative empowerment that would enable the federal government to realize its commitments This definition is laid down in all three of the postbellum amendments All three grant the power to Congress to enforce the basic framework with appropriate legislation True the new Congress takes as a given many of the provisions of the original Constitution The new order inherits an operating Congress Executive and Judiciary They would be recast in new functions but the forms remained the sameThe argument then is that the three Reconstruction Amendments enacted a second American constitution The terms of this constitution as culled from the amendmentswith some rearrangement and leaving out historically specific clausescan be stated in a few wordsThe Second American Constitution All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States No State shall deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law No State shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted shall exist within the United States The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race color or previous condition of servitude The Congress shall have power to enforce the foregoing provisions by appropriate legislationThese seven propositions summarize the enduring content of the Reconstruction Amendments The key provisions of these amendments define political membership articulate basic rights and provide an ambit of legislative competence So reformed the American system of government would be able to protect individual rights as well as promote the equality of all persons who survived the war Of course we must assume a set of institutionsa Congress an Executive and a Judiciarythat will continue to function according to the terms of their initial creationStill there is something missing in this filtering off of the three Reconstruction Amendments and calling them a separate constitution The missing factor is the consciousness of setting forth a new framework of government a structure based on values fundamentally different from those that went before To find that consciousness we need to turn I wish to argue to the critical message of the Civil War the address that would generate a new normative world in which to make sense of the epic war that consumed America from the firing on Fort Sumter to the surrender at Appomattox The new Nomos the new framework of values that necessitated a new constitution comes forth in one of the great prayers of the American civil religion the Gettysburg Address It is worth recalling some of the enduring phrases of this civil prayer the incantations that reverberated in American consciousnessFour score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation This nation was conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equalFrom these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotionWe resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom Government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earthIn the ensuing chapters we will look at these words and the entire address in greater detail For now I wish to make the unusual claim that these revered words serve as the preamble for the constitutional order that emerged from the unification of the nation They are a preamble in much the same sense that the language beginning Conscious of our responsibility before God and humanity provides the organizing principle of the new German constitution or the following words echo in memory as the convening of the Philadelphia ConstitutionWe the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect Union establish justice insure domestic Tranquility provide for the common defense promote the general Welfare and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of AmericaConstitutional preambles speak in prophecy They set forth a vision of the futurefor the broad purposes of the national charter that they introduce And most important they define who the people are who share in the constitutional vision The original preamble in the Philadelphia version stressed the position of We the People as the enactors of the Constitution For Lincoln the body politic expressing itself in the new constitution included the prior generations who four score and seven years ago adopted with great courage that proposition of equality that gave birth to the American nation Those represented in the new order included the dead at Gettysburg and at all the battlefields of the war who if the new order is realized shall not have died in vain And furthermore because he avoided all partisan references in his address he clearly meant to articulate a conception of the nation that included the South as well as the North black as well as white Ultimately the beneficiaries of the new order would be the future generations of the nation those who would flourish under a new birth of freedomTo say that the Gettysburg Address provides the preamble to a new constitutional order is to say the least a bold claim When Lincoln took the train up to Gettysburg in November he had in mind only to comfort the mourners of those who died in the fierce fourday battle in early July The bodies were being pulled together from the battlefield and spared further decay The soil was turned and the dead laid to rest The battle had turned the tide of the warjust barely mind youand it was time that the president began to articulate the meaning of the long suffering that culminated in the gruesome handtohand fighting in the Gettysburg fieldsAt the ceremony dedicating the Gettysburg cemetery Lincoln was designated the second speaker The renowned orator Edward Everett spoke for two hours before the president mounted the podium He had a written text with him that amounted to about words Perhaps Everett prepared the audience to absorb the poignancy of Lincolns message Perhaps the very brevity of Lincolns words lent them additional power The impact of the address was felt not only by the mourners gathered at the new cemetery but by an entire country yearning for a sense of meaning in the bloodshedTrue the Gettysburg Address was not legally binding but preambles are never meant to have the status of positive law They are designed to explain why it is necessary for the government to bind itself to certain objectives Lincolns preamble accepted in the hearts of the nation explains the meaning of the war and provides a guide to the building of a constitutional order based on nationhood equality and democracy The setting of clear goals in inspiring languagethis is all one can expect of a constitutional preambleThis constitutional order stands in radical contrast to the Constitution drafted in Philadelphia and amended by the Bill of Rights in It defines membership in the American nation it brings the principle of equality to the fore and it initiates the process of extending the franchise to virtually all adult citizens The original Constitution did none of these things It slighted the problems of nationality and citizenship it sidestepped the problem of equality and it minimized the significance of popular democracyThe Irrelevance of Original IntentAt the outset I should be clear about the claims I am not making and the methods I am not using Above all I am not making an argument about the original intent that lay behind the Reconstruction Amendments Nothing strikes me as intellectually and morally more impoverished than the current trend in constitutional scholarship to believe that the wishes desires and intentions of the founders should determine the content of our Constitution There are two major hurdles that the advocates of this method have never negotiated First we need an argument about whose wishes desires and intentions really matter If we think we are bound by a certain take on the world that prevailed in or then we should decide whose sentiments matter Should we look to the people who wrote the document to the majority who voted for it to the states who ratified it or to the people as a whole for whom these various democratic agents acted Among all these possible sources of original intent there was intense conflict I would imagine that even those who actually voted for and against various drafts suffered from doubt and changing sentiments But even if each person voting had a concrete intention to support every sentence he or she endorsed there is no coherent way of finding a common denominator among their divergent positions A single intent cannot unify the inevitable cacophony of desires that stand behind every piece of legislation But let us suppose there was a single intent of the group We then encounter a more basic question Why should we care what the founders actually thoughtThe best political theory to support the relevance of original intent would be to think of the lawgiver as something like a military commander The commander wants us to do something and has used the language of the law to move us toward action We should try to figure out what these purposes are and execute them And if we dont Well the commander cannot really punish us but somehow we would be breaking faith with the framers if we dont act with the appropriate subservience or at least act as though we were submissive to the original intent of the founders This I regret to say is the best reconstruction I can offer for a view that never seems to get articulated namely why we should pay so much attention to the wishes and desires of the agents who bequeathed to us the words we live byIn great historical moments of law making as well as literature writers choose words that resonate far beyond their original context When the representatives of the colonies pledged their sacred honor in July to a document that included the words All men are created equal they may merely have intended to stress the equality of all collective peoples the new Americans had as much right to choose their form of government as did the British They also could have had the limited purpose of arguing that they were of the same moral status as King George III If all men are created equal then no one of them can claim to be anointed as ruler by divine right The only source of legitimacy as the Declaration argues is the consent of the governed Whatever their intentions as individuals or as a group may have been their words had lasting significance They bequeathed a great maxim to the American peoplea maxim that would in due course serve as the battle cry of emancipationWhen the drafters and ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment adopted a commitment to equality under the law they did not think particularly about whether they wanted to bring about integrated schools Yet a vast literature has grown up around the question of whether the original intent of the Fourteenth Amendment was to integrate the schoolsan event that the Court did not mandate until in Brown v Board of Education The dispute seems to be entirely irrelevant The complex body of national and state legislators who drafted passed and ratified the Fourteenth Amendment did not think about a single system of education for blacks and whites There were too many other issues on their minds We cannot attribute to them an intention to have all Americans study together in the same classroom nor can we burden their memory with a commitment to keep black and white forever apartThose who frame constitutions and constitutional amendments obviously have some purpose in mind but the purposes are typically abstract If they want to bring about equality among all Americans they do not want to be bothered with working out precisely what equality means at each stage of historical evolution If you had asked them whether ninety years later the schools should be desegregated they would have been nonplussed by the question Well that is the reason we have courts would have been the typical reply The Fourteenth Amendment established an ideal it affirmed an idea that has roots in the Declaration of Independence The drafters implicitly endorsed the principle that all men are created equal and because they are created equal they are entitled to equal treatment before the law What this language should mean in practice was not their concern Together with scholars who reflect on the ideas behind the law the courts assume responsibility for the proper interpretation of the language that constitutes a shared heritage of government principlesI never cease to be amazed that legal scholars particularly in the United States continue to be confused about the relevance of the framers original intent Secular legal systems could not possibly be more demanding more deferential to authority than religious cultures that believe that their binding legal principles were declared by God Yet a story from the Talmud beautifully illustrates the folly of invoking original intent in a dispute about the meaning of Gods commandments A group of rabbis were engaged in a debate about whether a particular earthenware oven was kosher or not One of them Rabbi Eliezer said no the other rabbis said yes Rabbi Eliezer proceeded to invoke a variety of fantastic signs to support his view at his command a carob tree was uprooted and flew across the field a stream flowed upstream and the walls started to collapse before they were halted The rabbis were not impressed by these signs Then Rabbi Eliezer desperate and alone invoked the argument of original intent If I am right let heaven be the proof A heavenly voice then proclaimed How dare you oppose Rabbi Eliezer whose views are everywhere the law Rabbi Joshua arose and quoted Deuteronomy It is not in Heaven Rabbi Jeremiah explained the reference Ever since the Torah was given at Mount Sinai we pay no attention to heavenly voices for God already wrote in the Torah at Mount Sinai The point is that once the language is released and given to jurists to fashion to the needs of their time the task of lawgivers is finished Their intentions and desires cannot ruleeither from the grave or from heavenThe intention of those who framed the Reconstruction Amendments should therefore not control their interpretation today But what about the intention of Abraham Lincoln when he mounted the podium on November There are some who will say that if Lincoln did not intend specifically to articulate the preamble to a new constitution then the words spoken at Gettysburg could not possibly be as I claim the preamble to the postbellum constitution If Roosevelt did not intend to amend the Constitution with his courtpacking plan then the resulting changes in Supreme Court attitudes could not constitute a de facto amendment a radical transformation of American lawHere we take a page from British constitutional history to understand how a practice can be become part of the accumulated historical constitution without this being the purpose of those who initiated the practice The British Constitution remains as is well known famously unwritten Customary rules determine the role of the Crown in a system that has evolved as a constitutional monarchy Only the accepted practice of generations prescribes that the queen must sign legislation for it to be binding as law or that the queen may intervene under certain circumstances to break a party deadlock and select a nominee for prime minister In all systems of customary law the relevant perspective is not that of those who first engage in the practice but rather of those who witness the pattern of the past and adopt it as binding on themselves So it is with the Gettysburg Address The right question is not what Lincoln intended but rather what the words meant to those who looked to them as the explanation of the war and as a charter for freedom and equality for all Americans If the address had been ignored it would not have mattered what Lincoln intended But because these words were adopted into the civil religion of the United Statesthe secular meditation on who we were and what we were abouttheir life after formal recitation by the president determines their constitutional status They are the preamble to the constitutional order because we came to understand them as nearly sacred And although we did not until now think of this secular prayer as the preamble to a new order of nationhood equality and democracy that is what they becameThese words are in fact better known in the United States than the preamble to the first Constitution Schoolchildren routinely recite them and thereby imbibe the intuition that these words defined America after the Civil War Yet because we know these resonant phrases we rarely stop to listen and ponder the meaning of each wellcrafted line Let us now put ourselves among the crowd of mourners at Gettysburg Let us transport ourselves back into the frame of mind of those suffering losses those looking for the meaning of brothers slaughtering brothersFour score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal Now we are engaged in a great Civil War testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure We are met on a great battlefield of that war We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this But in a larger sense we cannot dedicatewe cannot consecratewe cannot hallow this ground The brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract The world will little note nor long remember what we say here but it can never forget what they did here It is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before usthat from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotionthat we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth A specter is haunting Europe Karl Marx and Frederick Engels wrote in as the first sentence of The Communist Manifesto The specter they had in mind eventually became a political movement that came to dominate nearly half the world in the twentieth century Behind this movement however lay an even more powerful idea that Marx had inspireda Marxist conception of reality The marketplace of economic relationships is not what it seems to be Workers enter into seemingly voluntary contracts with employers but underlying this system of apparent cooperation is a vast system of exploitation Those who hold capital reap profits off the backs of those whom they hire as their laborers This generates a dynamic of history that should according to the theory eventually produce a revolution by the exploited class of laborers This theory failed to recognize the just contribution of capital in generating the opportunity to work and the political incarnation of Marxism turned out to be historically more transient than expected Nonetheless the insight remains with us that relationships of employmentindeed all forms of relationshiprequire more than nominal consent to be legitimate Behind the appearance of voluntary interaction there lurks the everpresent possibility of unjust exploitationThe Marxist challenge was but the beginning of a continuing critique of the idea of freedom so revered at the close of the eighteenth century Behind the nominal appearance of freedom lies a structure of influence a set of conditions that influences people to make the choices they do Sometimes these influences are morally desirable Peer group and family pressure can lead people to finish their university degree or to stay in difficult marriages or to remain loyal when tempted to act in selfinterest Looking back individuals who make these choices under social influence are often grateful for the external inducement to do the right thing Yet economic and social conditions can also lead people to enter into socially and economically oppressive relationships abusive marriages and postures of dependence on drugs and alcohol They can be induced to undress and prostrate themselves on stages in front of booths with oneway windows The fact that people are influenced by others or their economic and emotional needs is in itself morally neutral but the results can vary widelyThe Paradox of FreedomThis is the paradox of freedom in modern times We still believe that freedom is the great contribution of American democracy to the culture of the West Freedom was our rallying cry in the decadeslong battle against the political enemy that Ronald Reagan labeled the evil empire Although Martin Luther King Jr dreamed of a society committed to the proposition that would realize the American vision of equality under law the word that would sound from the mountaintops would not be equality but freedom Let freedom ring King reminds us in the memorable refrain of his dream In his choice of words King harks back to Lincoln who recognized our commitment to the proposition that all men are created equal but hoped that the emancipation would generate a new birth of freedomWe may be willing to die in the name of freedom but we can no longer pretend that we live in the uncomplicated moral world of the eighteenth century In a postMarxist world we know that freedom requires more than the experience of choosing We cannot escape our recognition that nominal freedom leads sometimes to exploitation and oppressionThe late eighteenth century was indeed a marvelously simplistic time Adam Smith could write in the same year as the Declaration of Independence of the wonders of a free market based on the voluntary cooperation of producers and consumers and its invisible hand that would produce the maximum possible welfare for humankind Immanuel Kant could glorify freedom in his theory of law published in a theory based on the absolute right to enter into any contract that one chooses to make And of course the great monuments to the eighteenthcentury understanding of freedom are the Constitution and the Bill of Rights These documents are revered because they are designed to protect the individual sphere of freedom from a presumptively aggressive and overreaching central government The basic freedoms protected in the first Ten Amendments ratified in include freedom of speech and the press freedom of religion the right to bear arms the right to privacy against state intrusion in ones home and papers and a plethora of rights designed to protect suspects of crime against the federal governments power to investigate and prosecute All of these freedoms or rights are understood to be a matter of opposition of the individual against the government They imagine a dyadic conception of governmentthe individual pitted against the stateThe significant feature of our basic freedomsapart from the franchise and those that arise in the criminal processis that we can imagine enjoying all of them in a state of nature We do not need government in order to exercise our freedom of speech or religion to bear arms or to be free of state intrusion in our homes As these rights are formulated government acquires the image of the interloper the enemy the potential violator of our freedom to do as we pleaseAnd who do we fear will invade and intrude upon our island of freedom At the time of the revolution the fear was directed toward King George III and his colonial governors In the newly established Republic the fear was redirected toward the federal government This dyadic opposition between individual and state underlies most constitutional thinking to this day The fear of the federal government has grown into distrust toward all government According to the official doctrine the Bill of Rights only applies to limit state action encroaching upon individual liberty As Akhil Amar recently formulated the idea officials of the state are likely to act for their own benefit rather than the benefit of its citizens Therefore we must be eternally watchful against overreaching by the state The purpose of the Constitution is to arm us with the legal means to check the tendency of the statefederal government and indeed all forms of governmentto limit our natural freedomBut there is another model of thinking that recognizes the paradox of freedom If freedom can generate exploitation then the task of the state should be to intervene to protect the individual against the exploitation by other private individuals The paradigm of the exploitative oppressive relationship in the American experience is of course slavery and therefore in as the first task of the new constitutional order we banned the very possibility of private relationships of slavery established either by force or by consensual agreement between master and slave The Thirteenth Amendment charges the federal government with the responsibility to make sure that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall come to exist in the United States The amendment does not say that the state may not create relationships of subordination or slavery It says simply that these private relationships however they might come about shall not exist The important point about this formulation is not merely that it dispenses with the requirement of state action It does that and moreThe Thirteenth Amendment betokens an entirely new way of thinking about governmentnot as an everthreatening enemy but as a necessary partner in the building of a society free of interpersonal exploitation The focus of the Thirteenth Amendment is not on the potential evils of government but on the wrongs committed by private parties Unjust private relationships do not cease existing just because one declares them not to exist They can arise spontaneously and in a state of nature some people would inevitably come to dominate others The passive voice of Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist means that the government must be ever watchful lest relationships of exploitation come into beingThe new function of government departs radically from the dyadic structurethe individual pitted against the stateunderlying the Bill of Rights The relationship of government to private individuals becomes triadic or threecornered The relationship arises between two private parties slave owner and slave dominator and subordinate aggressor and victim The third pole is the government which must intervene to insure that the incipient relationship of involuntary servitude shall not existA triadic relationship between two people and the government represents an entirely new kind of constitutional order A dyadic focus takes the government to be the enemy The triadic orientation accepts the government as a partner in conquering evil The dyadic picture assumes that the desired form of liberty exists in a state of nature and it treats the transition to government as a threat to liberty The triadic conception recognizes the evil of domination inherent in a state of nature and treats government not only as necessary to rid us of that evil but as a welcome partner in the effort to build a civilized societyThis difference in the attitude toward government parallels a different understanding of freedom and how it comes into being The freedom celebrated by the Bill of Rights resembles an island of solitude a retreat from society Its ideal is the individual in the state of nature intimated by Henry David Thoreaus retreat to Walden Pond The individual stands alone fearful that a faroff agent called government will aggress against him and limit his freedom But the liberty that comes to the fore in the intended postbellum constitutional order and under the Secret Constitution requires the intervention of government Liberty is born in the states assertion of responsibility to oversee and prevent relationships of oppression The relationship between rights and freedom is thus turned on its head Those who identify with the Bill of Rights and the mentality of think of both rights and freedom as islands of autonomy protected by the walls of the law against the threat of government The view that comes to the fore in the Secret Constitution recognizes that freedom as well as rights depend on the proper interaction with government Government is not the enemy of freedom but rather the mechanism by which freedom is secured in a society that tends toward domination and oppressionThe assertion of a triadic conception of government brought us into line with the middle European conception of freedom as the privilege that arises from living in a matrix of protective state regulations It is not nature but the law that makes us free Freedom is realized not by the states absence but from the construction of a network of laws that liberate the individual from the oppression that would otherwise occur Compulsory temperance and drug laws generate freedom for those who are able to stay clean Prohibitions against sexual selfdegradation and peep shows strengthen the inner freedom of our human selvesThis is the European conception of constitutional freedom When the German Basic Law of declares human dignity to be the foundational value of the constitution the implications run through all relationships that may come into being This thirdparty effect means that private individuals are bound to respect the human dignity in each other precisely as they are bound not to subject each other to relationships of involuntary servitude or during Prohibition not to sell each other alcoholic beverages Today men and women must avoid sexual harassment on the job even though in this case the thirdparty effect arises not directly from the Constitution but from federal legislationAn activist tripartite conception of government requires funding Fighting a major military campaign to suppress the Southern insurrection required a stronger financial base than the government had needed up to that time The war drove up spending from the customary percent of the gross national product to percent By comparison in the early s government spending represented percent of the GNP With no place left to turn a Republican Congress approved the first income tax in By the income tax generated over percent of federal revenue the balance coming from tariffs and reintroduced excise taxesThe Civil War income tax lapsed in and when the direct tax against income returned to the national agenda in the s the times were different The disputes took on the tones of class struggle This time it was the Democrats who favored the tax as a measure of social justice Many of the wealthy who were affected by the modest percent tax denounced the measure as socialist Almost immediately after the taxs introduction a challenge under the original Constitution made its way to the Supreme Court where five of the nine justices were convinced that any form of income tax violated the prohibition against direct taxes not in proportion to the census Progressive politics as well as the governments demand for revenue generated a coalition that supported a constitutional amendment to reverse the decision of the Supreme Court By the Sixteenth Amendment found the necessary threefourths vote for ratification and the income tax became a basic tool of modern state financeThe origin of the income tax in the Civil War has largely symbolic meaning It testifies to the governments beginning to conceive of itself as an aggressive agent charged not only with winning a total war against states in insurrection but also with taking charge of the postbellum constitutional order that would be based on different premises from the social order of freedom and fear of governmentIn the second founding of the United States thirtyseven states constituted themselves as a single nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal The government would assume the task of supervising relationships in the commercial and private spheres to assay whether they were impermissible relationships of dominationrelationships morally equivalent to involuntary servitude The government was newly envisioned as a triadic structure powered by an activist wellfinanced government Unfortunately the Supreme Court did not clearly get the messageTwo Conceptions of GovernmentThe tension between two conceptions of governmentbipartite and tripartitecame to a head in a classic decision of the Supreme Court in The State of New York had enacted legislation designed to protect workers in the bakery trade Among other provisions the legislation limited the permissible hours of work to ten per day and sixty per week The legislation was based rather clearly on the assumption that employees are at a serious bargaining disadvantage and cannot protect their interests adequately simply by negotiating the number of hours they want to work The state was reaching out to the worker motivated by compassion for those who lacked the bargaining leverage to limit their hours of employmentThe defendant Lochner was prosecuted under a provision of the statute that made it a misdemeanor to employ someone in excess of the limit The Supreme Court concluded by a large majority that the statute violated the liberty of the employer and presumably of the employees as wellalthough the latter were not complaining about being prohibited from working too many hours A majority of five on the Court read the notion of liberty in the due process clause no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law as including freedom of contract The dyadic structure prevailed A similar analysis in the Peep Show case would have led to the conclusion that the women and their employers had the right to contract any form of selfexhibition they thought desirable Any other result supposedly implies paternalism Autonomy if not dignity requires freedom of contract as a basic rightThe alternative view of the case winning support from four justices including Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr and John Marshall Harlan was that limiting hours of employment was a legitimate way for the state to exercise its responsibility to protect the health of those who chose to work as bakers The dissent written by Justice Harlan explicitly addressed the problem of unequal bargaining power between owners and bakersIt may be that the statute had its origin in part in the belief that employers and employees in such establishments were not upon an equal footing and that the necessities of the latter often compelled them to submit to such exactions as unduly taxed their strengthJustice Holmes had the same point in mind when he wrote apodictically The Fourteenth Amendment does not enact Mr Herbert Spencers Social Statics In other words the principles of the free market economy need not be entrenched as a dimension of constitutionally protected libertyLochner ranks among the more widely scorned decisions of the Supreme Court The general complaint is that the Court ignored the interest of the state in furthering the health and welfare of its citizens To put this objection in other terms the opinion ignored the ascendancy of the tripartite conception of government The issue remains with usif only in a slightly different guise Since the late s the principle of freedom of contract has given way to the propriety of the state and federal measures to protect working people on the job Yet the question of liberty and its potential abuse in an oppressive relationship remains a flash point of debate Although the concept is not mentioned in the Constitution the freedom to say yes or no to particular commercial relationships has become an essential dimension of personhood It is as much a part of the basic liberty protected under the due process clause as the right to be free from unjustified physical restraintFreedom of contract enables individuals to express their personhood but it also facilitates relationships of oppression including slavery and involuntary servitude After all it is possible to choose to enter into a contract of slavery The book of Exodus permits the purchase of a Hebrew slave but after six years of service he shall go out free for nothing Yet there are people the Bible recognizes who prefer the condition of servitudeAnd if the servant shall plainly say I love my master I will not go out free then his master shall bring him to the door or to the door post and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl and he shall serve him ForeverIn this example the servant chooses the condition of servitude We know from the fate of many longterm prisoners that after a certain period they choose a life of dependence free of the responsibility of caring for themselves It is not impossible that someone might actually prefer the secure life of the slave to the anxious life of the free person who must care for himselfThere are two distinct grounds on which the law might sensibly prohibit the possibility recognized in Exodus First the claim might be that freedom and its blessings represent a great gift that no individual made in Gods image should be able to forfeit as though it were a disposable piece of property Alternatively the argument might be that in principle people have the right to choose to forego their freedom but that in reality these choices are always influenced by personal necessities that becloud the choice actually made This is especially true under market conditions where the need for sustenance can drive people into relationships that they would not choose in and of themselves It is clear that even the choice of the Hebrew slave discussed in Exodus can never be shown to be completely free The legal arrangements also stipulate in the same passage that if during his period of servitude the slave acquired a wife or children then he must leave them behind when he leaves his masters service Some purchased servants might decide to opt for permanent servitude simply because they cannot bear to live without their wives and family The full text in the quoted passage reads I love my master my wife and my children I will not go out free The cruelty of subjecting him to the choice between freedom and leaving his family obviously means that his choice is not free in any meaningful senseUnder modern capitalism there are many conditions that render choices less than fully free Material necessity is the most obvious But as we have learned from the history of alcohol and cigarette consumption advertising and peer group influence can lead people to develop habits that they later regret The same is true of heroin consumption which may readily develop into a condition of dependency in which the addict may enjoy the illusion of freely choosing not a hole bored in his ear but rather numerous telltale holes bored in his veinsThe question of exploitation and manipulation of consent has shifted from the economic to the sexual arena That is why the peep show case so beautifully captures our concerns about equality and human dignity The right to enter the romantic and sexual relationship of ones choosing is surely an important dimension of freedom It includes the right to marry the person of ones choice to choose and act upon a sexual orientation gay or straight to enjoy within appropriate limits reproductive freedom and to say no to sex if one is so inclinedThe law of rape has become a major battleground of American law The central question has become whether nominal consent to sexual relations constitutes actual consent deep agreement in the heart As in the economic context power tends toward exploitation The problem is particularly acute when the party seeking sexual favorsusually a manis in a position of authority over his desired partner The most hotly debated cases are spun from skepticism about whether nominal consent actually generates the kind of voluntary relationship that should be regarded as an expression of freedom rather than of exploitation The same is true of regulation of sexual harassment on the job If the boss promises advancement or threatens disadvantaged treatment on the job the appearance of complete and voluntary participation is readily undermined So far in the name of equality we are willing to tolerate rather intrusive regulation of dating practices in corporate or university settings but one can sense a coming backlash favoring the principle that students old enough to vote should be old enough to make a responsible decision about their sexual lives Making it a crime or private action for damages for coworkers or costudents to have sexual relations would surely violate the right to sexual autonomy now recognized as an aspect of liberty protected by the due process clauseThe problem of exploitation in apparently voluntary sexual relations has long been with us In the late nineteenth century the problem was whether the Mormon practice of polygamy should be regarded as protected as liberty and the free expression of religious conviction Those who defended the institution as provided in the accepted Mormon religious doctrines of the time cited its social benefit of caring for all the women and children in a society in which the available men had fallen victim to the hardships of settlement and warfare The critics by contrast claimed that the choice of the women in these cases is not really free and voluntary John Stuart Mill a great advocate of liberty sided with the critics of polygamy Western governments have had no qualms about prohibiting the practice sometimes for parochial religious reasons sometimes out of solicitude for women who are subjected to an institution that arguably diminishes their status The Mormons sued thinking they had the kind of argument that eventually prevailed in the Lochner case In the Supreme Court upheld the conventional view that the prohibition represents permissible intervention by the state to protect the weak against entering into exploitative relationships Many voices today argue that this decision was wrong The freedom to choose any form of domestic arrangement one wants should prevail against the states concern to protect people against their own potentially bad choicesThe same problem recurs in the current debate over physicianassisted suicide The argument for freedom and autonomy holds that individuals should be able to choose when and how to end their lives If they need the assistance of a physician to be able to die with dignity they should have that right The contrary view stresses the dangers of manipulated consent Once the possibility of voluntary euthanasia is recognized the danger presents itself that terminal patients will encounter social and economic pressure to consent to an early and painless death Again the problem is whether choices are as free as they seem on the surface or whether they represent the subtle pressures that lead us to think that the government should intervene to protect people from manipulation and exploitationThe anchor for this new conception of governmenta government that intervenes in private choices in order to protect individuals from exploitationlies in the Thirteenth Amendment Yet it seems very ambitious to derive all of this from a blackletter prohibition against private arrangements of slavery and involuntary servitude The fact is that we are not entirely sure how far we should extend the prohibition against unjust relationships of domination At the time the amendment was enacted it was fairly clear that the drafters and the public had a broad construction in mind for the Thirteenth Amendment became the constitutional foundation in for the first Civil Rights Actindeed the Act that is still used today to prosecute those who like the police who beat up Rodney King engage in racially motivated deprivations of civil rights Because the deprivations of civil rights were understood to be an instantiation of relationships of unjust domination it is clear that the framers envisioned a new constitutional order much broader than merely business as usual just without slaveryAcademic writers have found the Thirteenth Amendment a rich source for constitutional speculation Some have claimed that the amendment goes so far as to require the government to be watchful and intervene against child abuse Others have argued that the amendment offers convincing grounds for recognizing abortion rights Requiring a mother to carry a child to term arguably amounts to an oppressive form of involuntary servitude A third voice holds much in line with the argument of this book that the potential ambit of involuntary servitude includes all forms of employment and labor that are unjust and oppressive These are imaginative readings and others are possibleSome restraint is necessary We have to be mindful of the prospect that the values of the Secret Constitution might play themselves out more effectively as the informal restraints of civil society rather than as binding rules of law As we have seen our impulse to promote religion love for the nation and politically correct speech seems to yield greater results when the state holds back and limits itself to a gentle nudge in the right direction But more significantly we have to recognize that we are locked in ongoing contradiction between the values of our first and our second constitutionsThe first Constitution commits itself to freedom and the second builds both on a preference for equality and the recognition that freedom is often an illusion The lovers of freedom want the government to keep its hands off lest Big Brothers intermeddling do more harm than good The skeptics of the Secret Constitution place their trust not in the natural mechanisms of social interaction but in the judgment of a vigilant hierarchyThe first Constitution plays on the theme of distrust in government We must secure our freedoms against potentially abusive officials seeking rents by pursuing their own bureaucratic interests The second constitution presupposes trust in an aggressive government a watchdog of transactions that might slide into the forbidden territory of involuntary servitude In this regard public opinion seems to be at odds with the de facto tolerance of Americans for governmental action that is becoming ever more intrusive The public supposedly suffers from declining trust in government Yet in fact the average person tolerates actions by government that can make sense only on the assumption that those potentially affected by governmental abuse see Washington officials as their allies in a common struggle A good example is the census and the popular reaction The census form for the year like several before it poses probing questions about racial and ethnic identity The government wants to know how many blacks and other minorities live in particular sections of the country The questionnaire imposes a detailed grid of racial variations on people who might otherwise simply have thought of themselves as Americans or perhaps as minorities This information becomes relevant it is said to Justice Department officials monitoring the distribution of voting power in congressional districtsAmericans would not cooperate in answering these questions if they did not trust the government not to misuse the collected information There was a time when the government sought indirectly to find out how many Jews still spoke Yiddish at home One can be sure that the purposes of early twentiethcentury officials ever concerned about swelling immigration patterns were not benign And yet today the common assumption is that our officials may be trusted with a precise racial and ethnic map of the American nation Popular attitudes even go beyond tolerance for the intrusion into our personal identities Many people of multiracial backgrounds prefer to identify themselves as black on the theory that it enhances the interests of the African American population to appear as numerous as possible For the government to serve as the vanguard of a new constitutional order the people must trust officials in Washington with additional powers and run the risk of governmental abuseThis trust makes sensedespite the surveys in which people report distruston the assumption that the nation chooses to cooperate in the ascendancy of the government as the watchdog of equality and popular democracy The breach of equal treatment need not be feared and information on the distribution of potential voting blocks serves the cause of securing fair representation of all major groups in American societyYet the very effort to secure this fair representation of all voting groups threatens both the sense of common nationhood in the United States and calls into question the integrity of individual decision making in democratic elections Encouraging people to identify themselves as hyphenated Americans encourages multicultural consciousness and generates a growing sense of puzzlement about what it means to say that all Americans are of a single nation Also the assumption that black candidates can be elected only by black voters places us on a path that we cannot pursue to a logical conclusion It would hardly be consistent with the premises of popular democracy to considereven as a thoughtexperimentvoting districts that consisted primarily of women or gays The notion that particular groups are entitled to congressional representation merely as groups eventually runs squarely into the principle that in a democratic system individuals vote not as representatives of groups but solely as individuals They have no duty to a hyphenated consciousnessYet a trusted government can do much to remedy past discrimination and eliminate the badges of slavery A new conception of government might yet emerge to realize the ambitions of Gettysburg to ensure equality of all those created equal as it simultaneously promotes a new birth of freedom It is as though nothing has been resolved When the pursuit of equality begins to encroach upon our basic freedoms we are unsure where to turn With his carefully crafted twominute speech at Gettysburg the best political address in the nations history Lincoln created a Nomos a world of norms and meaning for comprehending the mass slaughter on American soil The new understanding of why we were in mourning pointed to a resolution of the conflict and the beginnings of a new constitutional order Rereading the speech now as the preamble to that new order we can begin to understand the significance of the phrases so carefully chosen The words of the Gettysburg Address are too powerful they represent too much concentrated energy and wisdom to be absorbed in the two minutes that it takes to read them slowly I suggest that we proceed and listen sentence by sentence phrase by phrase to these words heard so oftenThe first sentence states the heart of the matter and sums up the past present and future of the American commitment Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal This sentence alone was enough to formulate the preamble to the new constitution It harbingers the themes that follow in the address and that will come to dominate American life for the rest of the s Let us read each of these phrases as elements in the preamble to the postbellum constitutional orderFour score and seven years ago By a historical consciousness had taken hold in American thinking Rooting ourselves in the past stands in sharp contrast to the preamble of the Constitution which begins simply without setting the context We the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect Union There is no reference in the document to the first settlement dating back some years no sense that the new country was the outgrowth of an Englishspeaking culture across the seas In the nation still desired to create a more perfect Union but it had in addition a past that both inspired and troubled the newly indigenous psycheThe particular past that Lincoln cultivates retains its ability to surprise and to make us take notice One would expect the president to root his address in the Constitution that created his office but the great address is defiantly silent about the initial Constitution As the document was silent about its great embarrassment slavery Lincoln passes over a national charter that carried within it the seeds of war In this preamble for a new order the original Constitution is nowhere mentioned Lincoln locates the birth of the nation four score and seven eightyseven years prior to Until you do the arithmetic you do not realize that in Lincolns mind the critical moment of the founding was the signing of the Declaration of Independence For those who knew Lincoln well this might not have been a surprise for he had said two years before I never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of IndependenceThe historical retreat to the Declaration of Independence left Lincoln with a major paradox He claims to be speaking as president and his office owed its existence to Article II of the Constitution of Yet he thought himself back prior to the Philadelphia convention and the creation of the presidency He pulled the rug of legitimacy out from under his own office To be able to advocate the principle that all men are created equal that a nation was born committed to this principle he had to speak from a time prior to the creation of the government for which the Union troops diedThe precursor to this unusual mode of dating comes in an unexpected placein the final paragraph of the Emancipation Proclamation which went into effect on January Done at the City of Washington this first day ofJanuary in the year of our Lord one thousand eighthundred and sixty three and of the Independence of theUnited States of America the eightyseventhBy the President ABRAHAM LINCOLNIt did not occur to Lincoln that there might be some dissonance between his relying on as the beginning of the American nation and his acting in an office constituted by a document drafted in When he returned to the same figure of eightyseven years in November of the same year he meant to stress the continuity of the nation In Lincolns vision the men who died at Gettysburg gave their lives not for a government not for a constitution but to realize the peculiarly American blend of nationhood and a set of ideas particularly the idea that the nation was conceived in freedom There might be some disagreement about the moment of national coalescing but to be sure the nation was at war by A year later American patriots exposed themselves to great risk by appearing to have committed treason It is with some appropriate fear of reprisal that they conclude the Declaration of Independence We mutually pledge to each other our lives our fortunes and our sacred honorLincolns posture toward the Constitution was less than reverent He treated the founding charter of the government more as a guideline to action than as a set of absolute restrictions on his actions His decisions particularly in the early stages of the war suggest a willingness to assert extraconstitutional executive power and thus to permit the exigencies of war to restructure the government In April in the immediate shadow of the shelling of Fort Sumter he declared a blockade on Southern ports Whether the Union forces could properly seize ships without congressional approval became one of the early legal controversies of the war And then came the dispute about Lincolns authorizing his generals in the field to suspend the writ of habeas corpusthe great writ by which the courts retain the power to supervise the arrest and detention of criminal suspects The Constitution permits suspension of this protection in times of civil unrestbut fails to specify whether the president may act unilaterally in ordering suspension Sitting alone as a circuit judge Chief Justice Taney interpreted the constitutional provision to require congressional authorization for suspending the writ In light of Taneys notorious opinion in the Dred Scott case his views hardly carried much weight in the White House In a move widely regarded as authoritarian Lincoln simply disregarded Taneys opinion Lincoln justified his unilateral action with a famous claim of necessity articulated in a message to Congress on July The whole of the laws which were required to be faithfully executed were being resisted in nearly one third of the States Must they be allowed to finally fail of execution even had it been perfectly clear that by the use of the means necessary to their execution some single law made in such extreme tenderness of the citizens liberty that practically it relieves more of the guilty than of the innocent should to a very limited extent be violated Are all the laws but one to go unexecuted and the government itself go to pieces lest that one be violatedRead with our current sensitivity to civil liberties these are embarrassing words Lincoln argues in effect that he can justify violating a constitutional prescription by appealing to the necessity of the moment Of course if the stark option were posedviolating this one law or letting the government go to piecesmost of us would agree that the government should survive the emergency even by transgressing the Constitution Yet there is no evidence that the countrys circumstances were anywhere near this flashpoint of imminent destruction And Lincolns casual disdain for the writ of habeas corpus it relieves more of the guilty than of the innocent reveals a lack of appreciation for the point of constitutional protections in criminal procedure My own reading is that Lincolns suspending the writ on his own initiative and disregarding Taneys supposed invalidation of the decision testifies to an altered state of constitutional thinking The Constitution of lay suspended in the fires of battle A new constitutional order would arise from the war but no one quite knew what shape it would takeOf course during the war the Constitution remained nominally in force There was little suggestion of a military dictatorship though some Northern critics of the government invoked the phrase Lincolns elected term came to an end in March In the midst of the war therefore he was constitutionally required to stand for reelection This event in itself warranted the stability of American institutions but still ambiguity reigned on the shape of the postbellum constitutional order The confusion came to a head in when the House impeached Lincolns successor President Andrew Johnson for arguably asserting excessive executive power in firing his Secretary of War Edwin Stanton The outcome of that impeachment trial is well known Johnson avoided conviction by one vote Less well known is the outcome of the struggle to develop a new constitutional order the struggle that is signaled in Lincolns address commemorating the dead at Gettysburg our fathers brought forth on this continent The biblical cadence of these words resonates in memory We know that we have encountered it someplace before They remind us of the way God introduces himself to Moses in the Book of Exodus I am the God of your father So I have come down to rescue my people from the hand of Egypt to bring it up from that land to a land goodly and spacious to a land flowing with milk and honey It is not surprising that Lincoln would evoke the style of Exodus Even the introductory phrase four score and seven has a prophetic ring The Bible after all was one of Lincolns favorite booksalong with the works of Shakespeare and Aesops FablesGarry Wills makes much of the Greek influence in shaping Lincolns style at Gettysburg But of the biblical influence on the Gettysburg Address Wills has almost nothing to say This is a rather curious twist in seeking to understand the president whose thinking and rhetoric were probably more influenced by the biblical idiom than the writings of any other president Lincolns second inaugural address is replete with references to the Bible including notably the latter part of Psalm The fear of the Lord is clean enduring forever the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether Lincoln saw the entire Civil War as a righteous judgment of the Divine It is almost inconceivable that he would seek to formulate a framework for understanding the wars place in American history without relying on biblical imageryOf all the biblical themes that shaped Lincolns thinking the Hebrews Exodus from Egypt was the most compelling In a speech he gave in Trenton New Jersey in he referred to the American people as His almost chosen people The His refers of course to God The Americans stand one almost dares to say in the place of the Jews in a covenantal relationship with God The idea that some institution or some people replaced the Jews in their covenantal relationship was a familiar Christian theme The Pilgrims brought the idea with them as they founded their first settlements Now Lincoln comes close to repeating the Puritan idea This accounts I believe for the apparent redundancy in brought forth on this continent His audience would surely have understood that Lincoln was talking about the United States four score and seven years ago without locating the events on this continent But this continent was the locus of the new covenant The Pilgrims had made a journey to a new land and the new land promised a partnership with God that was not possible without an exodus from the old world The single word continent reminding us of the journey invokes an entire theologyWe should remember that although the Declaration of Independence overflows with references to the Creator and the imprint of the Divine in American destiny the Constitution of is a totally secular document In style as well as substance Lincoln returns to the religiosity of the Declaration brought forth on this continent a new nation The use of the word nation signals a major theme of the address In the remaining words it will appear four more times By accentuating the term nation Lincoln sets himself at odds with the first preambles invocation of We the People as the source of all legitimacy Now in place of the people appears the nation a term that with its connection to birth nasci Latin for to be born suggests a conception of the American people that extends over generationsreaching back to the founding eightyseven years before and encompassing those who will survive the war and flourish in its aftermathWe the People are sovereign in every generation A single cohort can found a constitution and another can presumably decide to withdraw from the commitment Thus some scholars have argued that the people of every generation retain the authority both to transform the Constitution or if they so choose to repeal it entirely I disagree If the American people are understood as a nation including the dead and the unborn then no single generation can undo the work of the past or renege on its implicit promise to the future There is no way that those who happened to be alive in the s could overrule the confirmation by preceding generations of the American union Thus by extending themselves out over history Americans became a nation in the European sense in the same sense as had already been realized in England and in France and was then making itself felt in the unification movements in Italy and GermanyThe midnineteenth century was a time in which the nations of the West tracing their lineage to common linguistic and historical roots built political movements grounded in a shared national identity In the same year that the Civil War broke out Italys Risorgimento or nationalist awakening entered its critical phase Thanks to the political leadership of Camillo Benso di Cavour in the north and the military prowess of Giuseppe Garibaldi in the south Italy achieved a unification of diverse states including Piedmont Sicily the papal states and Sardinia Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia became the first king of the united nation In by a combination of military annexation diplomacy and bribery Otto von Bismarck was able to unify the northern and southern German states in the Imperial Reich with Prussia as its central power There followed in the same year the enactment of the first panGerman criminal codeThis process of unifying the European nations and at the same time establishing a state to govern the nation had given us the idea of the nationstate The nation as a prepolitical reality finds its embodiment in the apparatus of state power The traditional view is that the United States was different that Americans were not a nation in the European sense I beg to differMy claim is that Lincolns address expresses the same idea that was then current in Europe Each people of common history and language constitutes a nation and the natural form for the nations survival was in a state structure The idea that Americans constituted an organic national unit explained implicitly why the eleven Southern states could not go their own way As he assumed the presidency Lincoln still spoke of the Union rather than a nation but in the course of the debates in the decades immediately preceding the notion of union had acquired the metaphysical qualities of nationhood In his first inaugural address Lincoln invoked the bonds of affection and even before shots were fired on Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor he stressed the unbreakable ties of historical struggleThe mystical chords of memory stretching from every battlefield and patriot grate to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land will yet swell the chorus of the Union The nation was bound together by historical experience and by its destiny its manifest destiny in the phrase used to explain the push westward that occurred in the decades leading up to the Civil WarLincolns purpose on November was not to intensify but to transcend the war effort Significantly the nation of which he speaks includes the South as well as the North He was speaking at the dedication of a Union cemetery but there is hardly a partisan word to be heard in the entire addressMy sense of the literature of American history is that our scholars not only ignore the biblical influences on Lincolns thinking at Gettysburg but also fail to understand the significance of the nation that our fathers brought forth on this continent The common mistake particularly of lawyers is to read the nation in this context as equivalent to the national government as opposed to states or to the national territory as opposed to local geographical units In this limited sense the nation is constituted by a federal government in Washington or by a physical space staked out on maps and recognized by other countries The nation is then equivalent to the Union or the federal government But the issue is not the authority of the national government in contrast to states rights The derivative sense of nationhood as denoting unified at a federal level is surely present as a subsidiary meaning in Lincolns invocation of the term but this could not possibly be all that he meant to sayThe American nation as it existed in was a nation in the European sense The assumption that drove the movements of national unification on the continent was that each nation should be able to govern itself And selfgovernment requires that each nation should be able to constitute itself as a state If this was the thrust of midcentury European history the same was to be expected of the immigrant nation of the United States a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal Thus ends the remarkable first sentence of the address The nation of which we speak is immediately qualified This is not simply a nation of common lineagean extension of tribal identity We are indeed different from the European nations for our nation is born of an idea It is conceived in liberty and dedicated to an aspiration of equalityWhat exactly does it mean to be conceived in liberty This phrase is so redolent with meaning that we simply savor it without reflection Does it mean that the nation is conceived free as if it were in a state of nature Is it only after its conception that the nation binds itself by the strictures of government It could mean these things Or it could simply mean that our first constitutional commitment was to freedom which as we shall see was certainly true Yet somehow the glorification of freedom of speech freedom of religion the right to bear armsamong the freedoms sanctified in the Bill of Rightsfails to capture the measure of being conceived in liberty Our liberty persists as our birthright even as we search for the proper way to build a democratic nation of equal citizensA stylistic point should intrigue us It is hardly an accident that in this phrase conceived in liberty Lincoln chose the Latinbased liberty rather than the Germanic freedom Conceived in freedom might have had roughly the same meaning but it would have lacked the lyrical ring The reason I believe is that both conceived and liberty derive from Latin as opposed to Germanic sources We return to this point later in the address when Lincoln links freedom rather than liberty with the image of a new birthWhat then is the relationship between liberty and equality in Lincolns vision of a new order We are conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition of human equality That was the way it was then and it is the way it is now The realization of equality in practical affairs will always elude us Even after this aspiration was incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment the ideal of equality remained a distant point on the spectrum of political possibilities Eventually women would be rendered politically equal and receive the franchise eventually the schools would be integrated and the laws against mixed marriages would with a sense of shame that they ever existed be struck down None of this was obvious in or or even in Yet the commitment Lincoln made at Gettysburgall men and women as individuals are created equalbecame a moral lodestar testifying to the equal dignity of all human beings whether the legal culture had validated that equality or notImplicit in this structureconceived in one value dedicated to anotherlies a conception of an ordered legal culture Some values are stated in rules that are capable of immediate realization others are stated as principles of aspiration The latter are ideals to be pursued opportunities for selfimprovement Liberty is a given Equality remains the promiseSome stylists have objected to Lincolns labeling the great maxim of the Declaration of Independence as a proposition Encountering this word in the first sentence the great English poet Matthew Arnold reportedly stopped reading in literary disgust Proposition was too legalistic for his taste But it was critical for Lincoln to restate his understanding of the Declarations vision of equality As he said in his Springfield speech in June They framers of the Declaration meant simply to declare the right so that the enforcement of it might follow as fast as circumstances should permit They meant to set up a standard maxim for a free society which should be familiar to all and revered by all constantly looked to constantly labored for and even though never perfectly attained constantly approximated and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its influence Immediately following the victory in Gettysburg in an informal talk at the White House on July Lincoln began the process of looking to and reiterating the standard maxim of Thinking of equality as a proposition gives it a reality an ontological presence in our lives not quite captured by alternative terms like ideal or vision We are conceived in one value and live anchored to another proposition not yet instantiated in our daily practicesIn structural terms this means that the Constitution of and notably the Bill of Rights represent the baseline They enshrine the liberty in which we are conceived But the ideals toward which we yearn are incorporated in a charter morally superior to the Constitution namely the Declaration of The Declaration served both as a legal brief for the War of Independence and as the standard for criticizing the compromise represented by the Constitution of The freedom achieved in the war against the English necessitated another war in to redeem us from tolerating the Souths peculiar institutionIn this magisterial first sentence of the Gettysburg Address there lurks ammunition for both sides in the great conflict that surrounded the calm of November The forces of the Union could draw sustenance as I have suggested from the reconceptualization of the American people as an organic nation But so far as the address also validates the case for separation from England it also provides an argument for secession from the Union What after all was the difference between Americas seceding from England and the Souths leaving the Union The Confederate loyalists could well argue that as their grandfathers had consented to the Union they were entitled to withdraw their consent They as a group were equal to the people of the North and therefore they could choose which form of the social contract would work for themWe sometimes forget the context in the Declaration of Independence in which we find the phrase All men are created equal The claim of equality prepares the reader for the more important thesis that all men as equals possess certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness The purpose of government is to secure these rights The people consent to government as their agent to realize these ends But if any form of government should be perceived as destructive toward these ends then the people that originally gave their consent are entitled to withdraw it They are entitled to alter or abolish a government that departs radically from the one to which had given their consent It follows supposedly that the colonists were entitled to withdraw their consent to the government of King George IIIWhen fully stated in this fashion the argument of invites several observations First the colonists never officially gave their consent to the government of George III They grew up under the tutelage of the English monarchy and their adhering to the government of the Crown was something like a childs joining its family The most that one could say is that they never consented and that therefore when they matured and reached the age of consent they were entitled to say no By contrast the Confederate states did join the Union by signing the Declaration of Independence as states and ratifying the Constitution as states If they gave their consent to a form of government theyby the logic of should be able to withdraw from the pact Paradoxically it seems the logic of the Declaration of Independence applies more cogently to the claim of the Confederacy against the Union than to the arguments of the Americans against the BritishNote further that in the structure of the argument the premise of equality plays a curious role All men are created equal So what How does that strengthen the case against the Crown The cornerstone of that case is that governments derive their legitimacy from the consent of their governed If a people has not consented to their form of government the government is not legitimate This would be true even if within the society human beings were not all of equal dignity and status Whether some people were intrinsically superior to others or not they could all enjoy a collective right to withhold consent from a repressive regimeWhat then is the point of the Declarations claim that all men are created equal The answer is twofold First there is an implicit claim that as a people the Americans are equal to the British and to all other peoples If any people should be able to consent to their government then the Americans too enjoyed that fundamental right That they were a colonynurtured as the metaphoric child of the Crowndid not mean that they could not assume the posture of an equal people If this is the meaning of equality in the Declaration then it provides little support for Lincolns claim that the nation was dedicated to a proposition that implicitly required the abolition of slaveryA more compelling reading of All men are created equal would be that all human beings are equal among themselves as well as being equal as collective entities They are equal among themselves precisely in that they possess inalienable rightsthe same inalienable rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness possessed by everyone else Reading the document in this way enables us better to understand Lincolns posture toward abolition There is ample evidence that Lincoln regarded blacks as morally and socially inferior to whites He said so in numerous speeches in the s But despite these racist assumptions that were common to his time he fervently regarded slavery as an evil It was an evil precisely because it deprived blacks of their inalienable rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness They could not enjoy the fruit of their own labor Slavery was a system under which slaveholders were wringing their bread from the sweat of other mens facesThe nation is born dedicated to this proposition that all men are equal with regard to their basic human rights This idea is extracted from the Declaration of Independence but the rest of its argument is discarded as outdated There is no mention at Gettysburg of the requirement that the people consent to their government and that they should have the right to withdraw consent when unsatisfied Nor in light of the arguments utility to the Confederacy would Lincoln have acceded to the language of He would have little reason to argue that every generation had the right to consent or withhold consent to its government Now the nation was in place and the nation made claims across time No particular generation could undo the work laid so carefully in the pastThe address continues with a second sentence that locates us in the present Now we are engaged in a great Civil War testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure Thus begins the internal portion of the address which is devoted to the war and its dead Lincoln repeats the conventional label for the fouryear indulgence in bloodlettingthe civil war The word has the connotation of the private or domestic Code civil or of a phenomenon arising spontaneously up from the citizenry civil society The South preferred the expression the War between the States by which they hoped for recognition that the war was more than a rebellion and that the Confederacy had full legal status as a belligerent under international law Lincolns choice of the favored Northern expression is his only partisan word in the addressI prefer the unconventional label The War between Brothers or the Brothers War That is indeed what it was Brothers met and fought each other in the field But even more significant the slaying of men should be understood as an offering on the altar of fraternity For every seven slaves who were liberated at least one man had to die They gave their lives so that the nation might endure Significantly in this sentence Lincoln repeats the claim of nationhood and stresses that the great evil of the war is not that it threatens the federal government the Constitution or the Union The great danger is that the Civil War threatens the survival of the nation The nation of course includes both sides in the conflictThis conception of a single American nation accounts for Lincolns religious language in his second inaugural address delivered as victory seemed near on March Here Lincoln thinks of North and South as bound together in their religious devotion Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God and each invokes His aid against the other The prayers of both could not be answered The massive bloodletting of the fouryear war is seen as a divine response to evil in the American foundingThe Almighty has his own purposes Woe unto the world because of offences For it must needs be that offences come but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh The terrible war is seen as a woe and a scourge inflicted for the terrible offence of slavery The offense was committed by allthose who were active and those who were passive The nation suffered punishment for its collective sin But it could return to normalcy with the same sense of collective compassion and thus Lincoln extends his hand With malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right The president ends his second inaugural address in the expectation of peaceful reconstruction and with a gesture of solidarity toward the widows and other victims of the killing fieldsThe policy of malice toward none charity toward all is anticipated in the affirmation at Gettysburg of a single nation enduring as it were a calamity imposed for its sins Yet there was a deep contradiction between this charity expressed toward the enemy and the military objectives that were becoming obvious in the fall of In order to achieve the newly set goal of emancipation to achieve the end that in he calls the right as God gives us to see the right Lincoln would send his generals to wage total war against the civilian population Philip Sheridans destruction of the Shenandoah crops William Tecumseh Shermans conquest of Atlanta and then his march to the Atlantic all anticipate the terror that became commonplace some eighty years later in the bombings of Hiroshima and Dresden From Gettysburg to Appomattox Lincoln will maintain a political policy of charity and reconciliation coupled with a military posture that would leave no doubts about the right in the minds of the defeatedThe choice of the words Civil War to describe the conflict also expresses charity toward the rebellious Confederacy They are not treated as criminals attacking federal installations and killing federal troops Rather they are in a joint effort with their fellow countrymen to determine the future of the nationThere follow seven sentences in which Lincoln ties together the mourning of the moment with our commitment to higher idealsWe are met on a great battlefield of that warWe have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might liveIt is altogether fitting and proper that we should do thisBut in a larger sense we cannot dedicatewe cannot consecratewe cannot hallow this groundThe brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detractThe world will little note nor long remember what we say here but it can never forget what they did hereIt is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advancedIt is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before usthat from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotionthat we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain Let us leave this sentence in the middle and reserve the final peroration for a closer look Here in the heart of the address it becomes clear that the key themes of the preamble for the postbellum legal order are three nation death and dedication And the three ideas conveyed by these words are intimately connected The notion of the nation and the fact of death root us in the past These are irreversible facts The nation is born of history the dead link us to time past The fantasies of power the aspirations of We the People cannot undo the defining power of history The nation is implanted in time and the dead are interred in the plots that lie before the speakers dais Yet the dead can live and the nation can live if these shadows of the past are transformed into memory and memory is nourished by dedication to the values that define the nationLincoln remains ambiguous about the great task to which we should be dedicated so that these dead shall not have died in vain The longrange objective is the redemption of the nation from its offencesfrom its original sin of having tolerated entrenched inequality in the very framework of its original Constitution The immediate task is finishing the war and reuniting the nation We are not informed of the task that matters until the concluding two clauses of the address that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth Along with the first sentence these words have taken on a nearly sacred quality in Americas conception of itself and its mission in the world They retrace the three themes of nation death and dedication The nation is present now in conjunction with God The nation shall defeat death it shall have a new birth and it shall not perish The nation will surmount death with its new dedicationto freedom for allThese words have entered into the civil religion of the United States They are better known than the preamble to the Constitution of Let us pause and take a closer look that this nation under God The invocation of the Divine signals a major departure from the resolutely secular nature of the Philadelphia Constitution The Declaration of Independence itself repeatedly refers to the Creator Yet the Constitution of studiously avoids any word suggestive of a power higher than the will of the people The purpose of the national charter is to serve the goals enumerated in its preamble justice domestic tranquility the common defense the general welfare and securing liberty and its legitimation lies exclusively in the possibility that a federal government will advance these worldly goals This was fitting for a Constitution that sought to distance itself from countries that had established churches at the national level and that relied on religious tests for public office There would be none of that in the United StatesSignificantly the abolitionist movement in the s s and s brought a passion for religious truth in American politics that had not previously existed Theodore Parker among other devout leaders of the movement preached against the Slave Power in tones that made one think that the devil was marching into the new territories The recognition that slaves too were made in the image of God provided a powerful rallying point for a crusade to correct the original mistake of Of course various biblical passages served the other side as well but the ardor for abolition drew heavily and indispensably on the sense of a higher lawThe Gettysburg Address as written apparently did not contain the reference to this nation under God As he spoke Lincoln spontaneously broke with his prepared text The reference to God appears in neither of the drafts that his assistants John Hay and John Nicolay said were the prepared texts Yet the four journalists who were present reported hearing the divine invocation though some observers have Lincoln saying this nation shall under God have a new birth rather than the word order that has come to be accepted this nation under God shall have a new birthThe reference to this nation under God reinforces the conception of the nation as an organic entity a single subject that could like the Jews enter into a covenant with a God The substitution of the Americans for the covenanted Jewshowever sacrilegious the idea may soundlanded in the New World with the Puritans and became a standard item of Protestant theology Thus we can understand Lincoln referring at Trenton to the Americans as His Gods almost chosen peopleThe Civil War was not only a war to establish the unbreakable bond that unites all Americans It was also a war understood by many Lincoln included to have theological significance It drew its power from religious claims about the humanity of all human beings and its leaders found their solace in psalms and prayers To close his second inaugural address Lincoln expressed the faith The judgments of the Law are true and righteous altogetherWe can date the advent of civil religion in the United States to this period of theological ferment in American politics It was at this time that the government initiated the practice of printing IN GOD WE TRUST on our coins and currency It is hard to imagine that any other country in the Western world would permit their moneythe currency of secular commerceto advertise a religious message Yet nondenominational expressions of faith have become normal in the rituals of the American people Opening sessions of Congress with a prayer using the Bible in swearingin ceremonies recognizing Christmas and Easter as national holidaysall of these rituals testify to an abiding nondenominational religiosity Americans are virtually united in their willingness to advertise a widespread faith in God For some reason this is not generally understood as contradicting the principle of separation of church and state laid down in the First AmendmentThe phrase nation under God has acquired an almost casual banality A generation after the end of the Civil War in the practice of reciting the Pledge of Allegiance spontaneously swept the country In the original version of the pledge we swore allegiance to one nation indivisible In the sense that something was missing persuaded President Dwight Eisenhower to return to the formulation that crossed Lincolns lips at Gettysburg One nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for allAs a nation under God Americans have been both blessed and cursed by a sense of mission in the world Covenanted with higher powers the nation has a destinya manifest destiny as journalist John L OSullivan dubbed our policy of westward expansion in the mids The phrase took hold and gave American politicians a sense of national purpose as they annexed Texas in negotiated a division of the Oregon territory with England and led the country into war with Mexico a year later This was territorial aggrandizement in the name of the nation under God These were the aggressive moves that established most of the boundaries of the western United States as they are todayThe firm belief in manifest destiny and territorial expansion led ineluctably to the Civil War As long as the Union was fixed at a certain number of slave states and a certain number of free both sides could calculate the future The South could count on the continuation of its peculiar institution despite fierce opposition in the North But the westward expansion and the absorption of new territories led to intrigue and suspicion about whether slavery would be permissible in the new states that would eventually develop out of these territories The acceptance of slavery in the original Constitution might have been an unholy compromise With manifest destiny and the occupation of new territories the compromise became not only unholy but unstable shall have a new birth of freedom Here near his peroration Lincoln reaffirms the foundational value of the Bill of Rights Freedom of speech of the press of the right to bear arms in a free statethese were the motivating values of the original constitutional order They would be cherished in the new order as well but for the first time freedom would be available to all There would be no scar in its connotations as there was in the threefifths compromise which for purposes of representation in Congress counted the whole number of free persons and threefifths of all other persons That distinction between the free and the unfree would disappear in the birth of a new constitutional orderOur stylistic question recurs Why did it seem more natural for Lincoln to use the word freedom in this context than liberty Somehow it would not do to speak of a new birth of liberty The opposition of conceived in liberty and new birth of freedom convinces me that the Latin origins of the first conue en libert in modern French and the Germanic roots of the second eine neue Geburt der Freiheit in modern German lends internal harmony to these phrases It is almost more than one can expect of Lincoln the great stylist that in forging a new nation of black and white he should recall for us the melding of the English language from Latin and Germanic sources and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth In this final phrase that along with the opening four score and seven years ago has become the most familiar cadence of the address Lincoln formulates an additional commitment of the postbellum era The government should be elected by the people it should be of the people and exist for the people The entire nation would vote at the polls And government would serve the entire nation At least this was the aspiration It would take several more generations for the nation of voters to absorb not only black men but also women of all racesThe hypnotic cadence of by for the people did not originate with Lincoln at Gettysburg In an speech to an antislavery convention in Boston Theodore Parker had used similar language in explaining the new American conception of democracyThat is a government of all the people by all the people for all the people of course a government of the principles of eternal justice the unchanging law of GodThere might be a strong link between thinking of the United States as a single organic nation and bringing God into politics but it is much harder to make out Parkers view that a democratic government would function under the unchanging law of God The democratic idea is that people remain free to change the law by majority vote A more generous interpretation of this phrase is suggested however by Parkers linking the law of God to the principles of eternal justice As the law of judicial review would eventually develop in the United States Supreme Court these principles of eternal justice provide the bedrock for testing the constitutionality of state and federal justice under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment One could well accept then the idea of a universal popular franchise exercising its authority to make and change the law under the check provided by eternal principles of justiceParkers and Lincolns commitment to popular democracy represents a clean break with the limited forms of indirect democracy recognized under the Philadelphia document drafted in According to the litist republican scheme envisioned at the founding the only institution that would be popularly elected would be the House of Representatives and that body would be chosen by the group that was qualified to elect the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature Two delegates to the Senate would be elected by each state legislature The president was and still is to be elected by an electoral college chosen by the voters in each state The original Constitution was silent not only about who was entitled to be a citizen but also on the questions of whether only citizens and which citizens should be entitled to vote All this was left to state law and the states generally limited the franchise to white male adult citizens who owned the requisite amount of property The word democracy is not even mentioned in either the Constitution of or the Bill of RightsWar has a democratizing influence Men fight side by side and when they lay down their arms they expect to be able to rule side by side It is not surprising then that in the aftermath of the Civil War we find a new commitment to government by all the people The postbellum constitutional order takes the expansion of the franchise as one of its first priorities In the Fifteenth Amendment secured the right to vote regardless of race color or previous condition of servitude Of the ten succeeding amendments from the Sixteenth to the TwentySeventh leaving aside the Eighteenth on Prohibition and the TwentyFirst repealing the Eighteenth seven have addressed the extension of the power of the people to choose their government In short the securing of Lincolns promise of universal popular suffrage became the primary focus of the new constitutional orderThe Gettysburg Address understood as the preamble to a new constitutional order underscores four values that stand in radical relief to the motivating concerns of the Constitution as it stood with the Bill of Rights in In outline form these are the constitutional structuresRevolutionary ConstitutionCivil War ConstitutionDates Dates Proposed ratifiedPreamble in went into force amendedReconstruction amendmentsby the Bill of Rights in and Source of authoritySource of authority We the PeopleThe Nation as Defined by HistoryPrimary value Primary value FreedomEqualityMode of government Mode of government RepublicDemocracyHighest power Highest powers Will of the livingCommand of history divine missionThe contrast could not be stronger And most significantly the four new points of reference were all articulated in the Gettysburg AddressEach one of these groupings hangs together with internal coherence It makes sense for a constitution that glorifies the will of the living also to take freedom as its highest value Our Philadelphia charter was very much a document of eighteenthcentury reason it placed faith in the capacity of men to order their affairs as they saw fit Four score years of history proved that their selfordering led them as Lincoln put it in the second inaugural into committing offences for which they would pay with a terrible warThe new constitutional order begins more humbly with obeisance to both God and the finer strains in our own historical tradition It partakes of the historicist thinking that dominated German Romantic thought at the beginning of the century The spirit of the timesthe Zeitgeist in Savignys classic phrasewas speaking in the triumph of the American nation and its commitment to the equality of allThe new constitutional order cohered as a compelling ideological whole The values of nationhood equality and democracy were interrelated and mutually supportive precisely as was the original trilogy of peoplehood freedom and republican litism But Lincolns vision of a new constitutional order may have been too radical for the jurists of the time There emerged reactionary forces that sought to mystify and entrench the values of Before turning to the counter thrust of postbellum history we need to understand more fully the internal coherence of the constitutional order signaled by the Gettysburg Address The genius of the Gettysburg Address is that it took the words of the Declaration of Independence and found in them a crystallization of a meaning suitable for the refounding of American democracy In the idea that all men are created equalfor all purposes had no precedent in the declarations of political leaders Even the great French Declaration of the Rights of Man issued thirteen years after the French Revolution preached a more limited version of equalityAll men are born and remain equal under the law In its original context the famous five words all men are created equal had a limited function They undermined the pretension of King George III to rule under the divine right of kings If all men were of equal stature under God then no one could claim to have been anointed as ruler by supernatural authority At the same time however the famous maxim could also be understood as referring to men as collective entities all peoples have equal status It was not particularly novel to argue that all nations all states had an equal claim to govern themselves The principle of national selfdetermination urged so adamantly in the twentieth century derives from the same source every nation is entitled to preserve its own culture cultivate its language and express itself as a subject of the international community International law is based on the idea that nations anchored in the form of states enter into legal relationships The states in which nations are embodied enjoy legal personalities They incur debts and significantly these debts are not extinguished by revolutionary changes of government The forms of the state come and go and the nation endures through it all It is no wonder therefore that the Declaration of Independence would assert that the American people were equally entitled with all other nations to determine their form of governmentThese two senses of the famous all men are created equal capture the ambiguous quality of the American revolt against the British It was both a revolutionary and an anticolonial war of independence The revolutionary spirit was captured in the categorical rejection of monarchy The anticolonial thrust appears in the assertion of the Americans equal claim to rule by consent of the governedMore farreaching than both of these original meanings however is the individualist interpretation All human beings are of equal dignity They are created equal and remain equal in the eyes of their Creator There can be no foundation therefore for the claim that whites are superior to blacks or that men should count more than women Of course many framers of the Declaration were slave owners and most if not all of them were patriarchal heads of households Yet they bequeathed to the world a rhetorical phrase that was pregnant with meaning deeper than many of them may have intended This deeper meaning lay embedded in the text ready to come alive for the first time as their Declaration became the sacred text of the American abolitionist movementLegal texts often bear one meaning on their surface and a higher meaning that requires faith and personal investment beyond the surface meaning A good example is the commandment in the Decalogue prohibiting homicide Allow me a short digression on the commandment against killing to illustrate the phenomenon of a text that carries one meaning on its surface and a more radical meaning beneathThe Hebrew expression in the Sixth Commandment lo tirtsach is generally read Thou shall not commit murder The term murder implies a prohibition only against unjustified killing implying the permissibility of killing in selfdefense Yet a survey of the sources in Jewish law reveal that the term also bears the interpretation found in many Christian translations Thou shall not kill Thou shalt not murder is a rule that we can expect people to follow but Thou shalt not kill hardly lends itself to the same strict enforcement The morality of not killing becomes an aspiration a challenge for people to realize in their struggle with imperfection Whether they can renounce selfdefense as the Mennonites appear to have done is a matter of personal moral realization Whether they can extend the prohibition against killing to all living creatures as some exemplary spiritual leaders have done depends on their moral evolution Those who eat meat are not wrongdoers or sinners They simply have not yet reached the highest point of aspiration One should respect the Buddha for respecting all forms of life by not killing but those who fall short of the Buddha are not subject to blameThe same contrast can be drawn between the equality of all nations and the equality of all human beings The equality of nations has become a postulate of the international legal order There may be debate about which groups of people constitute nations entitled to selfdetermination and representation in the international community but the principle seems to be accepted by all For the community of nations so recognized equalitylet us say with regard to voting rights in the General Assembly of the United Nationsbecomes a norm readily enforcedNot so for the equality of all human beings First it is not at all clear what we mean by equality why we should recognize it in all human beings and what we should do to realize equality in practice Even Lincoln did not favor the equality of blacks for all purposes including social and marital relationships And even if we think that all children are equal in the sight of God we might understandably bequeath our property to our own kin How much equality and the form that it should take remain a matter of constant debateAs in the case of not killing in the field of granting equality there is always more that one can do The minimum is recognizing an equal right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness This requires to be sure the abolition of slavery But there arises then the question of equality in the exercise of basic legal rights like owning property serving on a jury and testifying as a witness in court Some of these basic legal rights of equality did not accrue to women until well into this century At a further frontier is political equality namely the right to express opinions to vote and to hold office Further up the scale of equality we encounter equality of opportunity in economic competition Every individual should have the right to compete on an equal footing with equal education and the basic resources required for the marketAt this point in the spectrum we begin to make the transition from equality of opportunity to equality of outcomes Everyone should arguably have an equal claim to the worlds resources The manna of life in Bruce Ackermans apt metaphor should be distributed equally The accidents of birth prevent us all from having equal talents but perhaps those born with lesser talents should receive some form of compensation for their deprivation All other outcomes as John Rawls argues would be arbitrary from a moral point of view A similar form of compensation might be urged for those who fall short in the unfolding of their lives Some have bad luck in romance fail at their creative efforts suffer the accidental loss of a child An extreme egalitarian might see an injustice requiring compensation in these differential life pathsWe might refer to this layered set of possibilities as the spectrum of equality As in abstaining from killing one can cross the initial stage of this spectrum and remain unsure about how far to ascend on the scale To whatever height one ascends on the spectrum of equality there should be a strong connection between that perch and the reason for recognizing human equality in the first place Once again the analogy with the commandment against killing or murder proves instructive However much one becomes convinced that killing is wrong one needs a reason for that degree of conviction In order to renounce selfdefense you need a reason something to the effect that violence only breeds more violence Or if you wish to emulate the model of Albert Schweitzer you must say something like All living things are the creatures of God they all deserve to live This is not to say that your reason must be demonstrably correct but you need a reason for your commitment for it to make any sense at allThe abolitionists too must have had reasons for believing in equality in a way that both Northern and Southern fellow citizens rejected Abraham Lincoln too followed an inner logic in cultivating the deeper meaning of the Declaration of Independence And today we must also have grounds for taking human equality seriously as a basic ideal of social and political justiceProviding these reasons turns out not to be so easy As a descriptive claim the thesis all men are created equal is obviously false People differ in every conceivable respectsize strength intelligence musical talent beauty But being equal is not equivalent to being the same identical or similar Equality is a curious relationship and its model is arithmetic relations Two sides of an equation are stipulated as equal but this may not be apparent to the untrained eye For example x The two sides of the equation are not identical in notational form but equivalent in numeric value The suggestion is that all our differences are like notational form My DNA my biography my talents are certainly not the same as yours but these differences become superficial in light of the deeper equivalence of moral value What gives us this deep equality of valueSome philosophers have tried to analyze human equality by searching for some single factor by virtue of which we are equal We might all be equal because we can use language and say things like I am as good as you are Utilitarians claim that we are equal because we feel pleasure and pain John Locke argued that we are all equal because we are all the property of God Or as contemporary secular thinkers claim we are all equal because in principle we can act both rationally and reasonably All these arguments suffer from the same objection Suppose someone could not speak would he not be equal to other human beings Suppose she could not feel pleasure or pain would that put her outside the human community If he were not rational would he not be one of us None of these criteria alone could be an adequate test of equality unless it was accompanied by a theory that explained why that factor and that factor alone was sufficient to generate the strong sense of human equality Of little value as well is Lockes influential argument that we are the property of God Animals also belong to the same Creator but that does make them equal to humansModern philosophical approaches toward equality all suffer from the same flaw They are strongly committed vaguely to some position on the spectrum but they offer no reason why they are so intensely committed to this value that has become so powerful in the Englishspeaking West Human equality seems to be an unquestioned postulateone of those truths that we hold to be selfevident And those things that are obvious apparently require no grounding in reasons In the contemporary liberal culture equality is one of those values that has become so deeply held that it is neither questioned nor justifiedGiven the long history of popular belief in the intrinsic superiority of certain classes of peoplemen whites Christians Americansthe philosophical belief in equality stands as a critique of commonly held beliefs It is clear that the popular culture still harbors many biases about some people being intrinsically better entitled to greater privileges than others Yet the longrange popular trend favors overcoming our biases in favor of a belief in the equality of all humanity The American Revolution took the first step by abolishing the privileges of the nobly born The Constitution prohibits both the states and the federal government from granting titles of nobility There was this much equality in the founding but anchoring the peculiar institution of slavery in the Constitution was the great offence against equality that could be expiated only on the killing fields of Gettysburg and AntietamThe postbellum history of the United States has carried the egalitarian message of Gettysburg into the liberation of ever more marginal groups After the emancipation of blacks the movement for womens suffrage gained strength and finally triumphed in and then in unclear succession came the contemporary efforts toward the equal treatment of homosexuals illegitimate children the handicapped and even undocumented aliens The thrust toward inclusion of more and more groups within the inner circle of the equally privileged has been one of the central themes of American life Yet even the victory of the Civil War is not yet complete The badges and vestiges of slavery still haunt the land The quest for redemption from the original sin of slavery continues in our own timeOur sensibilities are conditioned by our history But however difficult the struggle we have a history of which we can be proud We Americans were the first to conceptualize the great maxim of equality and to label it a selfevident truth No other legal system so far as I can tell relies explicitly on the principle that all human beings are created in the image of God Yet all modern legal systems and international documents of human rights today subscribe to the principle of equality before the law Typical of the American influence is the French Declaration of the Rights of Man which provides in the second part of Article The law must be the same for everyone regardless whether it serves to protect or to punishEquality before the law is the most limited claim of human equality This form of equality applies only to fellow nationals and residents subject to the same legal order More ambitious are the arguments of the philosophers such as Ackerman and Rawls who claim that equality is the first principle of social justice At the outer reaches of principle we find the great maxim invoked in the Gettysburg Address All human beings are equal in the sight of GodLet us limit our thinking for the time being to the most modest claimthat all individuals black and white men and women gay and straight born in wedlock and out of wedlock should be treated equally under the law We did not recognize this principle in the Constitution It came into our positive lawthe law actually applied by the courtsin with the Fourteenth Amendment But what is the grounding for this transformation in our attitudes toward equality under law Did we need the more radical faith in equality in the sight of God to discover the imperative of treating everyone equally under the law Is equality under law limited to Americans If so why does the Fourteenth Amendment literally protect all persons against the American states that deprive them of equal protection of the laws These are the difficult issues to which we now turnThe Nation as the Crucible of EqualityGettysburg forged a link between the nation and egalitarian thinking that we sometimes forget The connection between the limited nation and unbounded equality has paradoxical overtones The nation is dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal The thrust toward equality has universalist implications Neither Lincoln in nor the founders in argued that only Americans were created equal The claim was that all peoplein principle all human beings on the planetare born with equal dignity Yet this universalistic thinking thins our commitment to equality to a point of fragilityEquality flourishes in an environment of mutual sympathy and reciprocal identification The love for each and the needs of each come to the fore in the affective bonds of family friendship tribe and by extension in the reciprocal attachments of nationhood The limited political sphere of the nation facilitates the recognition of others as human beings sharing a common history If blacks and whites Northerners and Southerners eventually men and women could respect each other as Americans participating in the same national drama they would lay a foundation for affirming their mutual equality They need not be brothers and not exactly friends but they could at last recognize each other as compatriots with a common language a single history and a shared futureThe source for this association between bonds of affection and equality lies outside the JudeoChristian tradition notably in the philosophy of the ancient Greeks The fullest development comes in Aristotles Politics and in the Nicomachean Ethics The idea of universal human equality was foreign to Aristotle but he did believe in the mutual recognition of equality within the bonds of friendship and other close associations Indeed wishing well for the other as an end in himself is an essential component of philia or friendship understood broadly and this sentiment Aristotle believed provides the necessary foundation for all virtuous behaviorEquality appears as a central theme in the virtue of justice as well as friendship The just person is one who pays due regard to his own interests as well as to those of others He is able to maintain the proper balance between his own interests and those of others This is an aspect of distributive justice that generally requires each person to receive a due or proportionate share of the good to be distributed Aristotle describes this proportion as an expression of geometric equality Similarly when one person wrongs another some correction is necessary This species of justice is also based on equality understood arithmetically The wrongdoer and the victim should both be restored to the state they were in prior to the wrong This might be done by compelling the wrongdoer to pay compensation from the gains that he has received in order to make up the loss to the victimThese virtues of friendship and justice require cultivation for they contribute to the flourishing of the virtuous individual Adapted to the nationalist argument for equality among all Americans Aristotles argument about friendship would go something like this we should treat all members of the American polity as equal with equal concern for their lives precisely as we would treat friends By so doing we as a nation will flourish and we as individuals will flourish from our taking the ends of our compatriots as seriously as we would those of friendsEach nation must seek equality for the sake of its own flourishing The sense of common destiny is nowhere better expressed than in the Jewish expression Kol Jehudim eruvim ze bze All Jews are responsible for each other In the rhetoric of American nationalism the metaphor of the chosen people of the substitution of Americans for Jews recurs as a familiar trope The sense of organic closeness is implied The responsibility of the American nation should run to all members of the nation defined in the Fourteenth Amendment as all those naturalized or born on the soil of the United States and subject to its legal jurisdictionNationalism becomes a virtue if it avoids hatred of outsiders as it encourages mutual respect among insiders This indeed was Lincolns ambition in seeking reconciliation in the Gettysburg Address and in his second inaugural address Accepting his idea of a new nation dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal would have enabled Americans to negotiate the postbellum period without selfseeking and rancor But this was not as we saw the way it happened particularly after the tragic turn at Fords TheatreAndrew Johnsons plan for Reconstruction was plagued by controversies about whether the previously disloyal were still full members of the nation and whether blacks once emancipated should ascend a step higher and receive the franchise on equal terms with whites Lincoln imagined grounding the equality between black and white Northern and Southern in a shared sense of nationhood With the rancorous infighting that dominated Congress in the period to the relevance of nationhood began to recede More important were the ideological issues of loyalty personal desert and political selfinterest The question of the black franchise became associated with the fears of Democrats that a coalition of freedmen and Republicans would dominate the postbellum SouthBut this should not surprise us Politics merely occupies the surface of our lives The giveandtake of daily conflict can lead us easily to forget both our shared purposes and our enduring principles The Civil War had ushered in a commitment to the equality of all members of the nation Whatever the struggle for adoption may have been the language of egalitarian principle came into force By we had in place a clause in the Fourteenth Amendment that was unique in American constitutional history no state could deprive any person of the equal protection of the laws What this clause would imply in practice no one quite knew We did know however that the legal idea of equality carried no historical gloss The Constitution had already spoken of privileges and immunities and the Bill of Rights of securing life liberty and property against deprivation without due process of law But the Constitution had never before contained the notion of equality of persons before the lawThe remarkable feature of this idealbearing language is that it protects all persons within the power of the stateall those whom the state can touch with its legal power This was hardly a selfevident way for the provision to be drafted Given the nationalist background of our sentiments of equality one could readily have formulated the clause No state shall deny to any American citizen within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws That is because we were bound together foremost as fellow Americans one would expect a commitment first to the equal treatment of all Americans The Weimar Constitution in Germany found this to be a perfectly natural way of formulating the commitment to equality All Germans are equal before the Law It was not until the postwar Basic Law came to be in that West Germany recognized that a commitment to equality had to be universal The provision now reads All human beings are equal before the Law The striking fact is that Americans came to this principle of universalization as early as As the distinguished German constitutional law scholar and philosopher of the Weimar period Gerhard Leibholz pointed out the Western theory of equality has united two distinct strains of thought The first is the Aristotelian principle which grounds the virtue of equal treatment in the affective bonds of friendship or by extrapolation in the ties of nationhood The Civil War enabled Americans of different cultural strains some with power others without to see themselves as compatriots of a single nation Their mutual recognition as partners in a common struggle generated a sense that at least theythe Americanswere created equalThe second great principle in Leibholzs egalitarian synthesis stressed the universality of all humans in the love of God This universalization derives from the biblical faith that all persons are created in the image of God The first is limited and circumscribed by the bonds of affective identification The second breaks the bonds of the nation and extends to persons unknown and unimagined We will allow ourselves a slight detour to explore these religious ideas and to understand their impact on the theory of equality as it developed under the Fourteenth AmendmentThe Religious Basis of EqualityThe abolitionist movement began on the heels of the Second Great Awakening of the first three decades of the century The country overflowed with the religious pursuit of selfperfection talk of the millenniumthe thousand years of peace before the Second Coming of the Lordand of the hand of God in human affairs The American revivalists adopted the Jewish idea that our purpose on earth is to complete and perfect Gods creation As historian William G McLoughlin sums up the fervor of the times The new consensus also included the belief that Americans are a peculiar race chosen by God to perfect the worldMany of the preachers of the Awakening supported the abolitionist cause but many others did not Faith in God and the higher law of revelation enables some people to confront the injustice they see around them it enables others to retreat and to find solace in their personal quest for salvation Religious beliefs also supported the cause of those who believed in slavery Lincoln summed up the ambivalent role of religious faith in the Brothers War Both sides read the same Bible and pray to the same God and each invokes His aid against the otherReligious faith hardly lays out a straight path leading to the affirmation of human equality Yet it is hardly an accident that many of the great abolitionists such as William Lloyd Garrison and Theodore Parker were ministers whose faith fired their dedicated opposition to the great sin of one mans owning another These men carried with them an intimate knowledge of the Bible yet they did not require a consensus of biblical interpretation to support their political commitments Frederick Douglass argued that slavery was a sin because by subjecting one man to the arbitrary control of another it contravenes the first command of the Decalogue He was appealing to the basic principles of monotheism But sophisticated biblical exegesis was unnecessary for those who shared the root intuition that slavery was an abomination Lincoln thought it obviously wrong for men to ask a just Gods assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other mens faces These were strong intuitions of evil tutored by religious faith but obviously not determined by the BibleThe religious abolitionists had every reason to be drawn to the Declaration of Independence there they found the religious inspiration for which they could search in vain in the secular monument called the Constitution We hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal Behind those created equal stands a Creatorthe source as well of our basic human rights for the text continues by listing the truths we hold to be selfevident that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness This noncommittal Deist theme runs through the rhetoric of God is mentioned only as natures God by virtue of which every people is entitled to a separate and equal station in the community of nations This is the basis for the American peoples claiming that no government may rule them without their consent The end of the Philadelphia Declaration resonates with another invocation of a higher power with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence we mutually pledge to each other our lives our fortunes and our sacred honorThe religious refrain in the charter of our independence differs radically from the flat secular tone of the Constitution which makes no reference to any of the words God Creator Providence divine or any of their synonyms The Constitution recognizes no power higher than the will of We the People Yet the close bond of religious zeal and American politics returns in the Awakening in the early decades of the nineteenth century a period leading not only to the abolitionist movement but also to the expression of religious passion in foreign policy particularly in westward expansion under the ideology of manifest destinyThe invocation of God in the Gettysburg Address is both accidental and entirely predictable It is accidental in the sense that Lincoln spontaneously added the divine invocation as he neared the end of the address The innovation was predictable Lincolns association of the nation and God derived from his deepest convictions He thought of Americans as Gods almost chosen people successors to the Jews in a relationship with the Divine that could be described as almost a covenant In the midnineteenth century it was relatively easy to believe that we were in the grip of a great historical force possibly emanating from a higher power IN GOD WE TRUST became a popular motto appearing for the first time on the nations coinage in Trust in God can generate diverse conclusions but this does not subtract from the obvious way in which at the time faith in God and the Bible nourished the radical claims of human equalityFor modern readers those who do not think instinctively in the idiom of Genesis and the Psalms it is worth reviewing the kind of argument for equality found in biblical sources The central idea that generates the concept of universal humanity or universal brotherhood is that we are made in the image of God As the story has come down to us from Genesis and And God said Let us make man Adam in our own image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the birds of the air over all the cattle and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth So God created man in his own image in his own image He created him male and female He created themThere is much to be said about the proper reading of this passage particularly in relation to the contrary story of creation in Genesis a story that supposedly justifies the subordination of women The proper reading of the text as I have argued elsewhere has God creating a single being both male and female God gives this being called Adam dominion over all the animals but not over the first woman yet to be created Only in the later story of the Garden of Eden do we encounter the curse and subordination of Eve For those who look to the Bible for guidance therefore it makes a tremendous difference whether one relies primarily on the egalitarian message in chapter of ultimate human dignity for all or on chapter with its story leading to the curse of women that they be ruled by their husbandsThat creation in the image of God resonated in the culture of the abolitionists is undeniable the advocates of emancipation readily read into the line all men are created equal the vision of creation set forth in Genesis If you believe that an individual is created in the image of God it is difficult to deny his or her ultimate worth There is no higher value than God and therefore partaking of that value confers upon all human beings ultimate human dignity This point is brought home in the grounding of the prohibition against homicide in Genesis Whoever sheds mans blood by man shall his blood be shedfor in the image of God he made Adam The infinite dignity of the potential victim generates an absolute ban on killing The dignity of the victim is as great as any person who might wish to kill him and therefore the homicide of an innocent is never justified This is a remarkable passage for an era in which the killing of the stranger the other was a routine occurrenceThe basic ideas of Genesis receive their best secular rendition in the moral philosophy of Immanuel Kant who takes the idea of creation in the image of God and bequeaths to us the idea of universal humanity We are all essentially alike as members of the human family We all partake of infinite human dignityIn the kingdom of ends everything has either value or dignity Whatever has a value can be replaced by something else which is equivalent whatever on the other hand is above all value and therefore admits of no equivalent has a dignityThe idea of human dignity which we now take to be a shared premise of Western civilization became the backdrop for our current faith in human rights and crimes against humanityThe Fourteenth Amendment is our placeholder in the evolution of egalitarian thinking We know very little about how much equality the framers of the amendment intended to secure and frankly it does not matter Each generation must struggle to assay how far they are willing to go in the name of egalitarian justice or by contrast how far they wish to surrender to the surviving countervalues of hierarchy In the aftermath of the Civil War it was clear ironically that black men were far ahead of white women in ascending the scale of egalitarian possibilities Black men acquired at least nominally both the right to vote and the right to serve on juries White women and black women alike would acquire neither until well into the twentieth centurySome might argue that because the United States lagged in recognizing equal legal rights for women the mood of would have been hostile to recognizing that women as well as men were equal in the sight of God When Lincoln said All men are created equal therefore he meant menonly males were equal in the sight of the Creator This objection is easily countered Lincoln explicitly invoked the figures of women in his discourse on human dignity In in his speech attacking the Dred Scott decision Lincoln explicitly refers to the dignity and inherent equality of black womenIn some respects she certainly is not my equal but in her natural right to eat the bread she earns with her own hands without asking leave of any one else she is my equal and the equal of othersEven if the textual evidence were silent however we would have to interpret all men are created equal as inclusive of all human beingsall variations of women men and children This inclusiveness follows from anchoring the great maxim in the idea that human beings were created in the image of God So God created man in Gods own image in the image of God created God it the first being male and female God created them I recognize that one reading of the biblical text widely accepted in various religious traditions holds that God did create a male Adam in his own image and later removed a rib to create EveRecognizing the inherent moral equality of women in did not mean however that they would receive full legal and political equality as did black men The notion of appropriate roles in life still governed relations among equals and it would take decades for Americans to grasp that the politics of equality can not brook the coercion of women into domestic apolitical roles nor could some misguided theory of social organization tolerate the relegation of blacks to a limited number of lowerstatus professionsHuman Dignity as a Placeholder for EqualityOne basic value remains curiously absent from those enthroned in the postbellum legal order The movement to redeem ourselves from the evil of slavery should have prompted a commitment to a value even more basic than equality the infinite human value of all human beings In the wake of the Holocaust the Germans recognized that this was the proper way to initiate the catalogue of basic rights in the Basic Law Constitution Human dignity is inviolable All state power is obligated both to protect this value and to respect it This provision clearly bears the imprint of Kantian moral philosophy which treats respect for human dignity as an absolute duty of all individuals including officers of the stateThe structure of Article I of the German Basic Law bears a striking resemblance to the Thirteenth Amendment which in its core provides Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist within the United States If we think of the prohibition against slavery and involuntary servitude as an affirmation of autonomy then the passive sentence of the Thirteenth Amendment could be rewritten without change of content in the form of the German Basic LawHuman dignity and autonomy are inviolable All state power is obligated both to protect and respect autonomy by eliminating slavery and involuntary servitudeThis would admittedly be an unconventional way of formulating the demands of the Thirteenth Amendment The usual commentary on the amendment stresses simply that it omits the requirement of action by state officials that we find in the Bill of Rights and in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments Yet it is clear that the postbellum order sought to declare a fundamental value as the symbol of the new United States The motive was similar to the impulse of the German drafters seeking to ground their postwar constitution in the humanistic values of human dignity There may be intriguing and important differences between human dignity and autonomy and we shall return to these later For now it is important to note merely that the postbellum legal order begins with a commitment of all state power to eliminate the evil that had cursed the United States since its foundingSignificantly both human dignity and autonomy both due process and equality transcend the limits of the nation It is not only our nationals who are entitled to these basic human rights All human beings all persons should enjoy the same rightsat least so far as they are within the jurisdiction of the state securing those rights Our commitment to nationhood generates the reciprocal sympathy that enables us to make the move from particular to universal We may come to understand the meaning of basic rights in the context of the nation but then we are driven to see that all persons whether members of the nation or not are entitled to the same treatmentAlternative ReadingsNot everyone agrees that the equality of all persons represents the moral breakthrough of the Fourteenth Amendment In an alternative version of the postbellum legal order also based on the value of nationhood Charles Black stresses the reliance on national citizenship in the first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside Membership in the nation is now defined by birth on the land and the fact of nationality legally recognized as citizenship generates the most basic right of the new legal order Black reasons that the amendment places citizenship at the center of the new constitutional order No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States The centerpiece of the new order therefore should have been citizenship and the elaboration of the privileges and immunities of citizenshipThe appeal of Blacks reading of the postbellum legal order is that it too draws on the Declaration of Independence and the Gettysburg Address The key phrase in his reading of the Declaration is not the commitment to equality but the clause immediately following that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness Black imagines these words coupled with the language of the Ninth Amendment which implies an unspecified catalogue of rights retained by the people These inalienable rights should express themselves in a catalogue of human rights including the right to sexual privacy to reproductive freedom and to governmental services necessary for the pursuit of happiness The latter might plausibly encompass education medical care a minimal standard of welfare and perhaps even guaranteed employmentThere is much to be said for Blacks interpretation of the constitutional text He brings together strands of our legal culture that until his writing seemed to lack internal coherence He grounds his argument in the familiar rhetoric of rights He builds his interpretation on critical planks of the postbellum legal order namely the ideas of nationhood and national citizenship Yet the content of his argument reverts back to the language of rights inalienable rights rights retained by the people He invokes the rhetoric we associate with our eighteenth century Constitution enthroning freedom over equality True as the title of Blacks book reminds us Lincolns address does rely on one phrase to establish a link with the old legal order A New Birth of Freedom Yet Black ignores the cardinal values of equality and democracy which along with nationhood represent the cornerstones of the postbellum legal orderTaking the privileges and immunities of citizens as the pivotal value of the new order as Black does creates its own problems of equality under law Why should only citizens and not resident aliens enjoy the inalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness Do not immigrants and even undocumented illegals have rights as human beings The universalist language of the Declaration of Independence hardly dovetails with the parochial category of citizenship in a particular governmental polity If all men are created equal if we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights it cannot be the case that these rights are limited to those who are classified as the subjects of a particular sovereignTo be sure the Reconstruction Amendments had to define citizenship in the United States at least to heal the divisive scars left by the Dred Scott decision That infamous act of judicial will which served only to fuel the passions for war held that a former slave could never become the citizen of any state That is why the amendment adds that citizens of the United States are citizens also of the State wherein they reside They could avail themselves therefore of a body of law already developed to secure the mutual recognition of the states of all Privileges and Immunities of citizens in sister states As history would have it however the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment has not hadat least until recentlyany impact on constitutional debates The language has lain latent in the text of the Fourteenth Amendment Whether it will find a suitable purpose in a constitutional scheme built on equality and due process remains to be seenBlack pursues the theme of freedom and ignores the phrase that in fact requires emphasis in reading Lincoln a new birth of freedom The redemption and renaissance of our country would become possible only by confronting our offences and that meant recognizing and compensating for the evil of slavery The issue that could stimulate a new birth of the nation therefore was not freedom itself but freedom tempered by equality before the lawYet there is reason to applaud Blacks reading of our history as there is to honor the divergent views found in Bruce Ackermans and in Akhil Amars writings Ackerman focuses on the de facto transformation of government wrought by the Fourteenth Amendment enacted by a rump Congress in violation of the express language of the Constitution Amar too reads the history in his own way The postbellum legal order in his view shifts our focus from rights that enable us to participate in government to rights that celebrate individual freedom May all these readings flourish They testify to the innate multiplicity of meanings inherent in the second founding of the United States in the postbellum legal order Our only problem then as now is that we are not sure which way the revolutionary refounding of the nation should goThe Cusp of RevolutionBy and the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment we were perched on the threshold of a constitutional revolution An entirely new legal order was yearning to work its way clear from the turmoil of the s The foundation of this new order was painted bold in the phrases that resounded at Gettysburg nationhood equality and democracy The mechanism for implementing these exhortations would be the new grant of congressional authority in the final clause of the new amendments The Congress shall have power to enforce by appropriate legislation the provisions of these articles A more powerful central government was a critical part of the new constitutional order This would be a government that would raise income taxes as it started to do during the war This government would enact welfare legislation to care for the widows and orphans of the war And most important it would be a government that would have the capacity to supervise private relationships The Constitution was no longer focused just on the individual struggling to secure his freedom against the government The government would have an active role in protecting and securing the autonomy of its citizens As my rewriting of the Thirteenth Amendment would have it Securing and protecting the autonomy of labor would become the duty of all state power Government would have to keep a vigilant watch on all labor transactions to insure that there never again would arise relationships bordering on slavery or involuntary servitudeIn Congress began to act on its responsibility to guard against the aftershocks of slavery by prohibiting discrimination in all facilities open to the public African Americans were part of the public and they should be entitled as a matter of equality with others to have access to public transport theaters and hotel accommodations The first Civil Rights Act therefore would seek in the later words of Justice Harlan to eliminate the badges of slaveryThe commitment first and foremost of the new constitutional order was to the equality of all persons affected by the laws of the United States No one knew how far our collective promise to realize equality in American life would take us The Fourteenth Amendment could conceivably have been sufficient to insure equal voting rights for all doing away with the need for the Fifteenth the Nineteenth and later amendments to secure the franchiseWith these ideals in place we have to recognize that the guns of war had stilled very few of our fundamental social conflicts The rough and tumble of postbellum politics pitted one segment of the nation against the other The freedmen could aspire to power in the region where they previously had been slaves Northern carpetbaggers could join forces with Southern scalawags to remake the agricultural South in the image of the industrial North At stake was the class structure of the South with its landed gentry commanding a servile class of laborers Behind the political conflicts however was a remaking of the American conception of government And the states would fight by any legal means necessary to realize the position they could not secure with their sacrifices on the battlefields of recent memoryIf war in the famous saying of Clausewitz represents a continuation of politics by other means then postbellum legal disputes stood for a continuation of war by other means All the disputes that eventually led to armed conflict between the states would begin in the period after to plague the courts and throw into question the values that the war should have secured States rights the holding of blacks in a form of servitude called segregation withholding the franchise from womenall of these would remain central issues for at least another hundred years Revolutions are never easy The people who inhabit the new regime are the same as those who dominated the old detested order They cannot be expected to change quickly The judges who interpret the new law are basically the same as those who interpreted the old law Even if the law changes even if there is a nominally new constitution the process of reading the new document will gravitate toward the old The regime changes but the people are after all the sameThe ancient Israelites would spend forty years wandering in the desert before the passing of time would generate a new people unaffected by the mentality of the fleshpots of Egypt Modern political conditions rarely offer this luxury The Soviets dreamed of creating a new man who would regard the communist system as the natural backdrop for cooperation History never gave them the chance But Germans could engineer a radical transformation after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the unification of the country The West Germans absorbed the former German Democratic Republic and then restaffed the courts and the law faculties with new personnel drawn overwhelmingly from Western ranksFor Americans in the postbellum period the obstacles to revolutionary change were daunting Emancipating the slaves was one thing changing attitudes toward blacks was quite another Americans of the s were essentially the same people who had tolerated the institution of slavery their judges were of the same background and schooling as those who had declared in the Dred Scott decision that persons of African descent whether born free or born in bondage could never become citizens of the United StatesAs part of its reconstructing the former Confederacy the victorious North tried to cleanse the formerly rebellious governments of their treasonous followers The Fourteenth Amendment which the rebellious states were expected to ratify as the price for reinstating their right to representation in Congress included a clause disqualifying from public office in either the states or the federal government anyone who had taken an oath to uphold the Constitution and thereafter engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same This provision could conceivably have rid the South of those who supported the war for Southern independence but it could not liberate the North from its judges and politicians who were ambivalent about the equality of all citizens The membership of the Supreme Court changed entirely between the time of the Dred Scott decision in and the first major constitutional decision of the postbellum period in Yet the judges who came onto the court still carried with them the values and confusions of their antebellum youth They could not easily imbibe an entirely new spirit of nationhood and a strong commitment to equality Their justice did not express the vision of the victor but rather the reluctant judgment from within that the vanquished too had arguments on their sideSecuring a nominal legal change in the form of the blackletter rules of constitutional revisions was not so difficult The Thirteenth Amendment was ratified as soon as the war was over and the Fourteenth and Fifteenth followed within five years By the language of revolutionary change was in place The only question was whether the words on paper would bring about a fundamental change in American selfgovernmentThe three promises of Gettysburgnationhood equality and democracyshould have become the guiding values for interpreting the amendments that would govern postbellum America These amendments had the form of a new constitution They set forth the basic principles of government and each of them granted authority to Congress to realize the amendment with appropriate legislation The amendments needed only the backdrop of the three branches of government then in operation It would not have overtaxed the legal imagination simply to incorporate the existing structure of the federal government into the new constitutional orderHad the United States been able to begin anew with judges educated in the values and vision of Gettysburg with a new generation unaffected by old habits of thought Lincolns prophecy at Gettysburg might have prevailed The commitment to a single nation of black and white would have provided the foundation for a jurisprudence of equality in the courts The federal government would have become the watchdog of private relationships that approached too close to the forbidden line defined in the Thirteenth Amendment as slavery or previous condition of servitude The selfevident truths of the Declaration of Independencethe inalienable rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happinesscould have generated the foundation of a new constitutional order Yet this was not to be the fate of postbellum AmericaPart of the problem is the way we came to think of the great sacrifice that occurred on the battlefields of Gettysburg Antietam Vicksburgall the places where Americans rushed to give their lives for the sake of vague principles If we did not have the great articulation of the wars aim that Lincoln gave us at Gettysburg the entire enterprise would have reeked of the absurd I am fighting for my rights a Confederate soldier might have saidnot too sure what those rights were On the other side in blue rather than gray he might have said I am fighting for the Union with the nagging sense that dying for a governmental structure was slightly ridiculousThe Gettysburg Address was pregnant with the sentiment that the war expressed the fraternity of Americans The bond was expressed not only toward the slaves who were liberated but also toward the two hundred thousand black men who fought side by side though in separate battalions with white men to liberate those still under domination The national tiethe bonds of affection is expressed as well toward the Confederate men in arms who in Lincolns view never ceased to be part of the American nation This was a war between brothers It was necessary to settle the inevitable family quarrel about the kind of nation the United States would becomeAs American history took its course in the decades that followed the war for the nation we managed to betray the inner meaning of the great sacrifice that Lincoln sought to consecrate at Gettysburg We absorbed the war into the preexisting political and legal vocabulary We could have celebrated a new vocabulary of politicsa vocabulary we shared with Europeans who were then moving toward nationstates of internal solidarity And yet we ignored the appeal of the new for the sake of the old We drove the solidarity of Gettysburg underground We converted the ideas that should have become our new activist national charter into our passive Secret ConstitutionThe issues that concerned postbellum America were not the ideas of solidarity and reconciliation that Lincoln managed to articulate both at Gettysburg and in his second inaugural address With the assassination in April of the man who had preached a new order of ideas the United States became a country obsessed with power The great issues of the postbellum period breathed the tensions of institutional conflictThe party of Lincoln became the radicals in Congress and Lincolns successor Andrew Johnson himself from Tennessee with roots in the yeomanry of the former Confederacy was less eager than Congress to effectuate a cleansing of the governments that had supported the rebellion He was opposed to the Fourteenth Amendment which would have subjected the states to continuing federal scrutiny and he was at odds with Lincolns secretary of war Edwin Stanton who concurred in the effort to seek radical reconstruction of the South Fearing that Johnson would fire Stanton Congress passed a statute requiring congressional approval to remove a member of the presidential cabinet Johnson resisted he fired his secretary of war In retaliation the House began impeachment proceedings After a fierce trial that Johnson himself did not attend the president survived by one senatorial vote short of the required twothirds majority Johnson was humbled and offered less resistance thereafter to congressional policies including the enactment of the Fourteenth AmendmentBehind the Sturm und Drang of the nations first impeachment trial was a struggle for power between the Congress and the presidency Would the constitutional structure that emerged from the war more closely resemble the European style of parliamentary democracy with the executive cabined by congressional directives Or would the presidency remain an independent third force of government Wars have a way of throwing open basic questions of this sort and by unleashing aggression within a society a Civil War inevitably invites a redefinition of governmental power Thus a whole new set of issues came onto the agenda of constitutional discussionAmong the most important of these was the proper relationship between the federal government and the states This is the question of federalism that still preoccupies American constitutional lawyers There is no doubt that the federal government came out of the war more powerful than ever It had experimented with an income tax and therefore could look forward to more effective funding It had coordinated the armies of the states and now it would undertake to guide the redevelopment and integration of the South in a society governed by a new set of values The question now was whether under a new governmental structure with Washington at its head the individual states could nourish the principle that they were the residual source of governmental power as set forth in the Tenth Amendment The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the States are reserved to the States respectively or to the peopleIn when the Bill of Rights was ratified it made sense for the Tenth Amendment to affirm that all federal power derived from the states and from the people The Constitution represented a pact among preexisting states But the states that entered the Union between the founding of the nation and the end of the Civil War all twentythree of them could hardly be thought of as enjoying the same history of a prior state of independence as the original thirteen The new states with the exception perhaps of Texas came into being by federal fiat They were born in almost all cases of territories already possessed by the United States They were created as administrative units and then recognized as states To think of them as being the residual source of powers delegated to the governments that created them is the kind of selfdeception that only lawyers can deviseThe new states admitted by should have enjoyed only the autonomy that the federal government allowed them to have Yet the great myth of American constitutional theorythat the new states were just like the original thirteenprevailed Perhaps this sleightofhand was necessary to maintain equality among the states It would not do to regard the original thirteen as constituting one country superior to a second country constituted by states thereafter recognized Yet it would have made sense after the Civil War to recognize that the Tenth Amendment had lost its relevance to a United States that embodied a nation of equal AmericansThis is not to say that for the purpose of administrative efficiency it would not make sense to divide functions between the federal and state governments This kind of efficient allocation of functions would make sense against a conception of the nation as the foundation of governmental power Perhaps this concern for efficiency is all that lawyers mean when they talk about the problems of states rights and a limited federal government Yet the discussion remains haunted by the myth that the states admitted after the founding retroactively granted authority to the federal government that created themAn institution emerged to articulate and preserve this myth of autonomous states enjoying residual powers under the Tenth Amendment and that institution was the Supreme Court The Court had assumed the power to declare federal and state laws unconstitutional ever since Chief Justice John Marshall so interpreted our basic charter in In the fiftyfive years leading up to the Civil War the Court used this power sparingly In the postbellum institutional shakeup however the Court would become more aggressive in exercising its power to overrule decisions by other agencies of government It would articulate the ideasit would as we now say give the spin to our basic conceptsthat would define the fate of nationhood equality and democracy in postslavery AmericaHow the Court accomplished these acts of reinterpretation constitutes a major chapter in the intellectual history of the United States It is the history of the way in which we took the words of the postbellum legal order betrayed their inner sense and assimilated the new legal order into the original Constitution of Blending the new language into our old habits nullified the vision of a new legal order The principles that should have inspired postbellum America became our Secret Constitution remaining latent for decades before they would reappear to shape the contours of American law The story may be disheartening but it must be told To explore the process of reinterpretation I will focus on two leading Supreme Court decisions of the time the first Slaughterhouse decision and the Civil Rights CasesThe Plight of the New Orleans ButchersIn four years after the war was over the Louisiana legislature passed a statute that brought home the persistence of a dispute about economic freedom that reached back to the earliest stages of modern European and English legal history The great virtue of the case was to remind the legal community that many issues of freedom had nothing at all to do with the war of solidarity to preserve the nation and emancipate the slavesAt the time about one thousand people in New Orleans were engaged in the business of receiving shipments of livestock from boats coming down the Mississippi slaughtering the animals and packing the meat for distribution The Act claimed to concentrate the management of the livestock and meat packing trade into selected areas It provided that animals could be unloaded and slaughtered exclusively on the properties owned by two of the many enterprises engaged in the trade All the butchers in the area had the right to use these facilities but they had to pay a prescribed fee to the patented monopoly The ostensible reason for consolidating these activities was to protect the health of the city of New Orleans The Act was entitled An act to protect the health of the city of New Orleans to locate the stocklandings and slaughterhouses and to incorporate the Crescent City LiveStock Landing and SlaughterHouse Company The Act named seventeen people who were entitled to exercise the privileges of the incorporated company and further it imposed fines for every violation of the patent The excluded local butchers were enraged They thought as landowners they were entitled to use their land to house and slaughter animals as the market required They wanted nothing more complicated than to pursue their trade as they saw fit on their own landOn the assumption that the legislature had acted in good faith that there was no graft involved in vesting this authority in the Crescent City SlaughterHouse Company the controversy seemed to be an easy oneat least by contemporary standards of public regulation This was a reasonable exercise of the states police power its general authority to promote the common good The single slaughterhouse was in the nature of a public utilitymuch like a telephone or electric company that has received a franchise from the government to provide service to a particular area In describing the case Charles Black dismissed the controversy as trivial The complaint by the butchers should not even have generated a serious constitutional questionAt the time however the dispute claimed attention as posing fundamental issues The dispute reached the Supreme Court within seven years of Appomattox The passage of the Reconstruction Amendments was still fresh in the minds of everyone The age overflowed with visionbut not in the Supreme CourtThe argument was close but in the end the advocates of state power won in the Supreme Court the battle they could not win on the killing fields Five justices voted to uphold the Act granting a monopoly to the Crescent City Company All three of the articulated dissents empathized with the independent butchers economic freedom to carry on their trade without paying tolls to those favored by the Louisiana legislature Justice Stephen Field honestly expressed the intuition that motivated the search for legal arguments for the dissent No one will deny the abstract justice which lies in the position of the independent butchersThe reader will forgive me I hope for dwelling on these opinions of justices whose names we barely remember The confrontation was so deep and so wrenching for the history of the Constitution that these conflicts have taken on epic proportions Speaking for the majority favoring the autonomy of state power there was Justice Samuel Miller appointed to the Court by Lincoln in and on the other side we encounter three passionate opinions expressing sympathy for the plight of the independent butchers I shall focus here on the conflict between Justices Miller and FieldThe abstract justice mentioned by the dissenting Justice Field derives from the weight of history In the early stages of capitalism independent entrepreneurs found themselves embedded in a feudal system of overlords and toll collectors The lawyers for the butchers eloquently expressed the historical associations in prerevolutionary FranceThe peasant could not cross a river without paying to some nobleman a toll nor take the produce which he raised to market until he had bought leave to do so nor consume what remained of his grain till he had sent it to the lords mill to be ground nor full his cloths on his own works nor sharpen his tools at his own grindstone nor make wine oil or cider at his own press The plight of the craftsman is expressed equally poignantly the prying eye of the government followed the butcher to the shambles and the baker to the oven Reading this passionate language today we can grasp the way so many people felt about the principles of abstract justice favoring the butchers The struggle for the right to work and to retain the fruits of ones labor was one of the passions of the nineteenth century The same sense of justice that inspired Marx worked its way in the same middle decades of the century into the disputes of the butchers against the City of New OrleansThe problem was to capture in concrete legal terms the abstract wrong committed against the butchers The lexicon of American jurisprudence was freshly stocked with highsounding language in the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments Were these restrictions on the butchering trade an involuntary servitude as prohibited by the Thirteenth Amendment or were they a violation of the privileges and immunities of citizenship either state or federal or an infringement against the states duty to accord all persons subject to its power both due process of law and the equal protection of the lawsBefore they reached this rich stock of possible constitutional arguments the lawyers for the butchers tried a simple tack The Louisiana statute infringed the common law of England the basic principles of which had become the bedrock of American law One of these principles was that monopolies were per se invalid The leading jurist of the seventeenth century Sir Edward Coke articulated this principle in a case in which the Crown had granted an exclusive franchise to a London merchant to buy and sell playing cards of a certain type When a competitor was sued he claimed that he was free to engage in his chosen trade celebrating the principles of free enterprise the court declared the monopoly invalid This case would have been persuasive precedent for the butchers but for two hurdles that counsel had to negotiate The first was to brand the New Orleans slaughtering franchise a monopoly That proved to be problematic The dissenting judges had no trouble concluding that requiring the butchers to use for a fee a single slaughterhouse was as much a monopoly as though the act had granted to the company the exclusive privilege of buying and selling the animals themselves But the majority led by Justice Miller balked The Court was willing to accept the label of monopoly but denied the assertion that the butchers are thereby deprived of the right to labor in their occupation If the analogy with common law monopolies had held the second problem would then have consisted of transplanting the English practice of invalidating statutes simply because they violated as Edward Coke said in another leading case common right or reason There was no evidence that courts in the United States would or could invalidate statutes simply because they violated the common law The Supreme Court never took this attack on the Louisiana statute seriously It interpreted Cokes decision in the Case of Monopolies to be about whether the king could grant a monopoly Coke supposedly took the side of the Commons against the king but left open the question whether parliament could grant monopolies The impermissibility of the statute is dismissed with the rhetorical question Whoever doubted the authority of Parliament to change or modify the common law The notion of legislative power to regulate the economy prevailed The elected representatives of the people enjoyed wideranging discretion in the legislature to enact measures that had at least the nominal purpose of promoting the public goodTo find a way of striking down the Louisiana statute the New Orleans butchers would have to invoke a constitutional prohibition that would override the presumed competence of the legislature The specific clause would have to capture the sense of abstract justice favoring the butchers the sentiment of right and wrong that in the opinion of Justice Field no one could denyIn exploring the lawyers and the Courts arguments our primary concern should be the fate of the ideas proposed at Gettysburg as the foundation of the postbellum legal order Our task is to ponder the fate of the ideals of nationhood equality and democracy to understand how the second founding of the United States imploded and merged at least nominally with the first Constitution and the Bill of RightsNationhood and CitizenshipAs much as Lincoln sought to evoke a consciousness of American nationhood this idea did not readily resonate in the minds of lawyers The word nation was not used in the postbellum amendments I doubt if it even occurred to counsel for the butchers to come into court and argue that independent tradesmen had a right granted to them by the American nation to practice their trade without the duty to pay tolls and use specific facilities Their rights derived if from anyplace from universal principles governing the free market and dignity of working people Yet this very argumentthat the nation was the source of rights acquired under the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendmentswould show itself remarkably in a majestic dissenting opinion in The idea of the American nation may have been in the air in the s but it was not part of the stock of concepts that the Court would draw on directly to domesticate its abstract sense of justice The concept of an American nation was part of the American creed but it had yet to become a fixed feature of American law It enjoyed a fate comparable to the inalienable right to the pursuit of happiness as articulated in the Declaration of Independence The latter is sometimes mentioned in legal opinions but it never became the rationale for decision making in the courts It remains an article of faith as does the commitment to think of the American people as a single nationThe faith in the American nation along with the inalienable right to happiness constitute affirmations of the American civic religion They belong side by side with the frequent invocations on the currency of the affirmation of faith IN GOD WE TRUST These are the background assumptions by which we live The same is true of the sense of nationhood In the secular prayer to the flag and the nationthe Pledge of Allegiancewould spontaneously sweep the country It stood for the idea that the United States was one nation indivisiblea residue of the war between brothers that occurred thirty years before However important these ideas may be in American civic religion however much they dominate the thinking of Americans in the civil society that exists side by side with government they might not be suitable as legal doctrines for deciding court casesNationhood rings of romance It appeals not to the analytic mind but to the sentimental heart As between thought and emotion lawyers have a bias for the linear creations of mind The appeals of nationhood are left to poets Lawyers opt for its analytic counterpart citizenship As used in the Fourteenth Amendment citizenship is a purely formal idea dependent solely on ones place of birth In the debates about the rights of New Orleans butchers before the Supreme Court the notion of citizenship and its privileges became the stakeholder for any residual yearnings to express the rights of the nationPerhaps as Charles Black and other scholars have argued the privileges and immunities of national citizens capture whatever relevance the nation has to constitutional law The position is defensible though in my view there remain important differences between the romantic extralegal idea of nationhood and the formal legal concept of citizenship But let us leave these differences aside and imagine that if nationhood is to play a role in constitutional law it must become domesticated under the rubric of citizenshipThe original Constitution recognized both state and US citizenship Only citizensnot merely residentsof different states could bring their cases to the federal courts More important the pact sought to equalize the legal status of citizens across the country by guaranteeing that the Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States National citizenship either for a specified period of time or by birth was necessary to run for national office Yet the charter of said nothing about how one becomes a citizen either of a state or of the national polity The matter was left entirely to state law as it is today in the European Union In antebellum America as in the European Union today citizenship in the larger entity requires that you first pass the local hurdles set for local citizenship Leaving the matter of citizenship to the states meant that slave states could deny citizenship to blacks or to anyone they chose This proved to be disastrous in the Dred Scott decision where first Missouri and then the Supreme Court held that the bloodline of Africans forever excluded them from citizenship The first item of business in the Fourteenth Amendment was to establish who as a formal matter belonged to the American polity To find a simple definition the Constitution adapted the traditional English rule that it is not blood but place of birth that matters All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside Applying the traditional rule of jus soli to everyone born on American soilexcept for the children of diplomats and other people not subject to the jurisdiction of the countryhad the radical effect of eliminating family and racial history from the definition of the bond between citizen and government in the United StatesThis part is simple and direct Complications begin to arise as soon as we note the difference between US and state citizenship It would have been much simpler to have a single conception of national citizenship the same idea that one finds in virtually every other country in the world If the Reconstruction Amendments had really been an entirely new constitution the courts could have ignored the concept of state citizenship altogether Alas the Fourteenth Amendment itself mentions it Every national citizen becomes a citizen of the state in which he resides And to make things more complicated each form of citizenship carries its own privileges and immunities The original body of the Constitution prescribes that every state must respect the privileges and immunities of citizens of other states the Fourteenth Amendment extends the same duty of recognition to the privileges and immunities of national citizenshipThe problem that confronted the Supreme Court in the Slaughterhouse case therefore was twofold first how to interpret the relationship between two kinds of citizenship and second how to fit the abstract justice favoring the butchers claim into the confines of the privileges and immunities of either form of citizenshipDissenting Justice Field constructed an ingenious interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment that had the effect of promoting the butchers cause The first step in the argument was to find a principle of equality embedded in the clause prohibiting discrimination against citizens of sister states Although the original Constitution does not mention the word equality the privileges and immunities clause can be read as a mandate of equal treatment regardless of the state of originat least as to citizens Now let us suppose that Louisiana enacted a statute prohibiting outofstate butchers from using the Crescent City SlaughterHouse Company This kind of preference for one set of butchers over another would have been clearly unconstitutional as the case law in this area readily reveals It follows that if Louisiana cannot arbitrarily disfavor citizens of other states it would seem odd that they could do the same thing to a group of their own butchers Prior to the postbellum constitutional amendments there were a limited number of clauses that made the states accountable for wrongs committed against their own citizens The most notable were the prohibitions against ex post facto laws bills of attainder and laws impairing the obligation of contracts But these provisions hardly provided a foothold for attacking the special privileges accorded to the butchers of the Crescent City CompanyAt this point in the reasoning process Justice Field made his striking claim the very purpose of US citizenship was to fill this gap left by the other clauses in the Constitution It made no sense for the federal courts to guarantee better protection for butchers out of state than for those within the state To bring about parity between these two classesthe protected citizens of other states and the unprotected citizens of ones own statethe concept of US citizenship should protect people against the actions of their own statesThe intellectual problem was similar to the situation that occurred in international law after World War II The legal order among the nations protected citizens of foreign states against atrocities committed by the Germans but it did not protect Jews living in Germany against their own government This was a remarkable omission in the structure of international law To correct it the architects of the Nuremberg tribunal generated the idea of crimes against humanity Today in disputes from Rwanda to Kosovo we take it for granted that states have duties under international law toward their own citizens The Slaughterhouse Cases struggled to achieve the same breakthrough in the relationship between individual states and their own citizensThe conceptual hurdle in was the same as in In order for a state to have duties toward its own citizens the citizens must be considered as members of some entity higher than the state to be held accountable In other words the citizen and the state must both be considered as subjects of a higher legal order Nuremberg located German Jews within the higher legal order called humanity The victims of German terror were to be protected simply because they were human beings Justice Field thought correctly in my view that the notion of United States citizenship was akin to being the member of a legal order higher than the states a legal order to which the states themselves owed a duty to treat citizens of their own state no worse than the citizens of other states in the United StatesThere is little doubt that Justice Fields analysis though rejected in the Slaughterhouse decision eventually became the guiding principle for interpreting the Fourteenth Amendment The proper home for this analysis turned out not to be the dual concepts of the citizenship clauses but rather the due process and equal protection provisions in the neighboring clauses of the same amendment Both of these latter provisions it will be remembered are directed to the protection of any persons due process or any persons within the jurisdiction equal protection The drafting of the Fourteenth Amendment thus anticipated the theory underlying the Nuremberg principle of a crime against humanity Under the Nuremberg standard the international order imposed a duty on nationstates to treat their own citizens decently In the postbellum legal order the same result derived from federal constitutional principlesBut this gets us slightly ahead of the story The question remains why and how the majority of the court rejected Justice Fields ingenious construction of harmony between the two levels of citizenship Keep in mind what the stakes were There was no question that the states were subject to a higher legal order The only question was whether that higher order would be the order established by the federal government or the order implicit in the idea of humanity Would the controlling feature of the butchers living in Louisiana be their membership in the polity called the United States or their status as persons entitled to due process and the equal protection of the lawsFields argument carried four votes The other five members of the court recoiled at the thought that the states owed duties to a higher legal order called the United States US citizenship did not have the effect of leveling the distinction between local citizenship and being the citizen of another state To read the Reconstruction Amendments in this way would fetter and degrade the State governments by subjecting them to the control of Congress The primary issue as understood by the majority was whether the states would retain their own special authority over their own citizens an authority that was expressed in the police power to legislate for the common good The implication was that states could readjust private rights and obligations among their own citizens if doing so served the overall advantage of the states residents Granting a special franchise to the Crescent City SlaughterHouse Company was simply an illustration of a general authority to help some citizens and hurt othersall within the state What no state could do however was to seek to promote the interests of its citizens over the citizens of other statesThis we should note carried forth the struggle of the Civil War by other means The special solicitude shown to the relations of the State and Federal governments to each other and of both these governments to the people harks back to the rhetoric of the s about the asserted autonomy of the new states to decide whether they would go one way or the other on the issue of slavery It is almost as though the Civil War had accomplished only one objective namely settling the issue of secession while doing nothing to define the nation of the United States or to establish a principle of equality among all its citizensNonetheless writing for the majority Justice Miller constructed a plausible theory of what it should mean to be a citizen of the United States The picture presented is something like the posture of a supplicant toward a distant protector The citizen should be able to address representatives of the US government in person make claims against the higher power and receive its protection as a citizen abroad or on the high seas None of this is particularly radical and it fails to be sure to incorporate the commitments to nationhood and equality bequeathed by the Civil WarOn these larger issues the opinion of the Court proves to be a great historical disappointment The Miller opinions perception of our unity as a nation comes across in this remarkable sentenceAnd quoting from the language of Chief Justice Taney in another case it is said that for all the great purposes for which the Federal government was established we are one people with one common country we are all citizens of the United States The date of this other opinion is not mentioned but Chief Justice Taney it will be recalled was the author of the Dred Scott opinion which did indeed affirm that we were one white people and that persons descended from slaves could never become a part of it To cite Taney on the issue of American nationhood is a bit like invoking Al Capone on the rule of lawEqualityAnd equalitythat glaring omission from our original Constitution How did the Fourteenth Amendments attempt to rectify the sins of fare in the grip of the antebellum intuitions that drove the Miller court The five majority justices could have applied the equal protection clause and achieved the same result that Justice Field had engineered under his construction of the dual tracks of citizenship the butchers rendered dependent on the Crescent City Company were subject they could easily have concluded to impermissible discrimination That would not have been a particularly radical result and it would have established an enduring commitment to equality under the postbellum constitution But no the Court turned away from the larger issue of principle for the sake of overcoming a narrow historical injustice The evil to be remedied by this equal protection clause the Court writes was the existence of laws in the States where the newly emancipated Negroes resided which discriminated with gross injustice and hardship against them as a class In other words the only point of the new commitment to equality should be simply to eliminate the institution of slavery and its concomitant legal institutions But if that was the only purpose of the Reconstruction Amendments the Thirteenth had already done the job There was no need for the Fourteenth Amendment and its commitment to the larger principle of equality among all persons in the jurisdictionSusan B Anthony had already begun her campaign for womens suffrage but as of the date of the Slaughterhouse opinion there was little sympathy for moving the spectrum of equality up one notch to include women as a class worthy of protection Immediately after resolving the Slaughterhouse dispute the Court turned to the petition of Myra Bradwell to be admitted to practice law in Illinois There was no dispute about whether she was qualified She was a citizen of the United States and of Illinois and she had the training and character to make a fine lawyer but there was one problem She was a woman This was sufficient for the state to bar her admission and the Supreme Court with only one justice dissenting thought this was an acceptable exercise of state power After the Slaughterhouse decision it was a minor stretch for Justice Miller to conclude that practicing law did not fall within the ambit of privileges and immunities of citizens The amazing feature of the Courts decision in this case is that it did not even occur to the judges to justify the discrimination against women as compatible with equal protection of the laws The opinion is totally silent on the issue of equality This was the temper of the times In another woman Virginia Minor argued to the Supreme Court that Missouris denying her the right to vote violated the Fourteenth Amendment The Court resolved the matter by unanimous vote It did not even mention the possibility that the discrimination violated equal protection of the lawsApparently it lay beyond the imagination of the justices in the s that someday equal protection would be extended to protect all those created in Gods image It would protect not only racial minorities but also women children born out of wedlock aliens and all groups that suffered the stigma of arbitrary social and legal exclusion They ignored the abstract justice that screamed at them from the bold language of the new constitutional structure Rather they read the language to narrow it to confine it to historical circumstances in effect to defeat the vision of a new more just society Supreme Court justices are an inherently conservative lot but they are rarely as reactionary as these justices of the postbellum era The Reconstruction Court did as much as possible to convert the vision of a new order into our Secret ConstitutionYet the values of nationhood and equality would not remain forever hidden camouflaged in the deep structure of constitutional thought They would begin to reassert themselves both in the political arena and in the courts The debate in the Slaughterhouse case had failed to take seriously the issues either of nationhood or of equality The dissent never got to the question of equality because they were satisfied that the Louisiana statute violated the privileges and immunities of United States citizenship The majority never reached that point because as far as they were concerned the Fourteenth Amendment had the limited function of eliminating statutory discrimination against African Americans The Courts view that the purpose of equal protection of the laws was solely to protect blacks from apartheidlike legislation was so clearly narrowminded that it could not hold for long Fourteen years later the Court would extend the principle of equal protection to Chinese launderers in San Francisco subject to discriminatory enforcement of zoning regulations This was the first step toward a sensible jurisprudence of equalityThe historical associations of the Slaughterhouse dispute lend themselves to multiple perspectives For the advocates of the butchers economic rights the critical perspective was the long history of emancipating craftsmen and laborers from the feudal bondage that subjected them to a network of service and financial obligations For the dissenting judges the challenge posed by the case was the creation of a single national polity in which the states were obligated to treat insiders as well as they treated outsiders And for the majority the issue was the one that should have been resolved by the Civil War the struggle for power between the states and the federal government Unfortunately that struggle would continue to haunt the court for decades of contentious litigationApartheid in the TheaterIt is tempting to read the Slaughterhouse case as a decision by the Court to turn its back on the struggle for racial equality in the United States In fact as we should keep in mind the case had nothing to do directly with discrimination against former slaves The decision does however signal a great concern for the autonomy of the states for the revival of states rights against the federal government This could have generated a jurisprudence of deference to the states in their exercise of police power even if executive and legislative decisions had the effect of discriminating against former slaves In subsequent decisions however the Court established the basic principle that in the field of criminal justice at least the states could not treat blacks as an inferior class In one decision the Court upheld a federal penalty against a Virginia state officer who disqualified blacks from jury service And another decision in the same year reversed a state court conviction of an African American tried by a West Virginia jury on which blacks were not permitted to serve With respect to African Americans exercising the basic rights of citizenship particularly in the field of criminal justice the Court would be vigilantThe more contentious issues arose in defining the way the emancipated slaves could move and function as supposedly free citizens in American society The most fundamental rights of former slaves could not be taken for granted The first Civil Rights Act enacted in on the basis of the Thirteenth Amendments commitment to suppress slavery and involuntary servitude established elementary civil rights for former slaves the right to sue in the courts to be witnesses to have the same legal remedies and to be subject to the same penal and tax obligations as other citizens The act provided criminal penalties against any official who subjected any person to one of these basic legal inequalities on grounds of race color or status as an alien The difficult question was whether Congress could properly legislate under the Thirteenth Amendment to protect former slaves against informal but rigid forms of customary discrimination for example the denial of service in restaurants the refusal to rent rooms in hotels and the segregation of theaters The Civil Rights Act of Section provided that all persons should enjoy equal access to inns public conveyances on land or water theaters and other places of public amusement regardless of race color or previous condition of servitude Section attached a fine and a prison term of up to thirty days for committing the misdemeanor of denying someone access to these facilities for the prohibited reasons On the basis of these provisions the federal government indicted various suspected violators around the countryNew York San Francisco Tennesseefor having denied access to theaters and other public facilities Significantly all of these prosecutions were brought in areas that had been loyal to the Union in the war The defendants appealed their jury convictions on the ground that the Civil Rights Act exceeded the authority of Congress Their appeals were consolidated on appeal to the Supreme Court Eight justices decided that the Congresss effort to prevent segregation and apartheid in public life overstepped their authority under both the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments Accordingly the Court reversed the convictions and set free the defendants who enforced the color line in public accommodations The Court reasoned about the Reconstruction Amendments in the same sterile and truncated way we have already witnessed in the Slaughterhouse Case This discrimination in access to public transportation inns and theaters did not constitute an involuntary servitude for as the Court had the temerity to suggest these interactions in public were in the realm of social rights of men and races in the community The purpose of the Thirteenth Amendment was merely to declare and vindicate those fundamental rights which appertain to the essence of citizenship Of course this was obvious discrimination on the basis of race Why should it not qualify as the denial of equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment The Court focused on the wording of the amendment No state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws Only the states could violate the amendment And the particular persons who enforced the color bar at trains inns and theaters were not agents of the state Their actions did not constitute legislation by any government or executive action by any official wearing a badge of state authority And therefore the state was not responsible for these private persons denying social rights to black citizens The conclusion If the wrongdoing was purely social or private then the federal government could not punish it under legislation designed to enforce the Fourteenth AmendmentThis cramped and faithless reading of the Constitution has become obvious to us over time but it was apparent in as well The lone dissent by Justice John Marshall Harlan records with allusion and insight the betrayal of what should have been the postbellum constitutional order Harlan pinpoints the intellectual moves that led the court astray On the issue of state action Harlan recognizes the spectrum of possible positions ranging from purely private actions to the actions taken as the policy of the state To grasp the subtleties of the problem think of the following points on a spectrum of actions ranging from purely private action at home to the purely public functions of state officials Actions taken at home in the family with friends Actions taken in public by employees of private companies that serve the public for example a store clerk refuses to sell goods to a black person Actions taken in public by employees of an organization entrusted with a public function for example ushers at the opera or conductors in railroad cars refuse to seat blacks Actions by a privately owned utility that has a state franchise to provide service in a particular area for example Bell Telephone refuses to sell service to former slaves Actions taken by local officials on their own in defiance of governmental policy for example a local judge refuses to include blacks on the jury list Official policies of the government discriminatory legislation executive decisions not to hire blacksExcept for purely private actions at home and official policies at the other extreme the other points on this spectrum represent a mix of private decision making and government policies In fitting the Fourteenth Amendment to the reality of these diverse combinations the Court could have insisted on stage six as the threshold of behavior included within the scope of the amendment thus limiting the supervisory power of the federal courts to the official action of state officials But it was clear from the outset that this would make little sense Discriminatory application of sound laws could not escape federal scrutiny simply because state officials acted beyond the scope of their authority Limiting state action and official policies of the state would encourage officials to act beyond their legal competence Thus stage five came to be included within the ambit of state responsibilityThe fatal mistake in was concluding that everything below stage five could properly be classified as private or social Justice Harlans dissent stresses that stages two three and four are also actions in the public domain that implicate the state in various waysas enforcer as beneficiary of the surrogate private enterprise or by direct or indirect funding eg tax incentives Reading the Fourteenth Amendment with a view to what it was intended to accomplish would have yielded a more generous understanding of state action The range of constitutionally relevant action would have included at least actions fulfilling the public functions of providing transportation accommodations for travelers education and culture And if the Court had so interpreted the notion of state action it would have had no difficulty sustaining both the Civil Rights Act of and the convictions brought against the violators of the provision requiring equal access to theaters and other facilities open to the publicFurthermore as Justice Harlan pointed out the Court had read the new rights established by the Reconstruction Amendments as though they were just like other restrictions imposed on state governments for example the prohibitions against the states enacting bills of attainder impairing the obligations of contract or granting titles of nobility Therefore the Court could engage in close analysis of the specific prohibition against state authority and assess whether it was really the state that was responsible for the wrong committed against those who were shut out of facilities supposedly open to the publicThe Court ignored in Harlans clearheaded view of the case the critical feature of the Reconstruction Amendments namely that each of them grants Congress authority to effectuate the amendment with appropriate legislation This was the first time in our history that constitutional amendments carried with them an expansion of Congressional authority Accordingly it was up to Congress to decide how best to implement the general commitments explicit in the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments Congress had acquired a general police power in this area comparable to the state legislative power upheld in the Slaughterhouse CaseHarlans most devastating argument was that the courts had long assumed that Congress enjoyed a general legislative power to regulate the conditions of slavery The constitutional text of had stipulated a right of slave owners to recover slaves who had escaped into free territory On that basis Congress enacted the Fugitive Slave Law of which in a manner similar to the Civil Rights Act under attack had imposed a federal penalty on those who refused to cooperate in the return of runaway slaves If Congress could elaborate on a constitutional clause securing slavery surely they enjoyed an analogous power reasoned Justice Harlan under an express grant of legislative authority in the Reconstruction Amendments to eliminate slavery and secure equal protection of the lawsJustice Harlans position eventually triumphedbut not until our own time After a long process of litigation addressed primarily to the constitutionality of New Deal welfare legislation the courts expanded the authority of Congress to legislate on all matters affecting interstate commerce This became the basis for the Civil Rights Act of which finally enacted the broadgauged protection against discrimination that the Court had declared beyond the competence of Congress in Grounding congressional competence to counteract discrimination in its power to regulate interstate commerce smacked of legal convolution The better ground would have been precisely the original claim of authority asserted by Congress in the Civil Rights Act of Justice Harlans fidelity to Lincolns vision of the postbellum constitutional order becomes clear in his appeal to the concept of nationhood Of all the opinions surveyed in leading cases decided in the aftermath of the Civil War Harlans is the only one that comes close to conceptualizing the United States as a nation acting as a single unit When the term appears in the other opinions it is always as the adjective national Yet Harlans opinion is studded with references that replicate the usage that we heard in the Gettysburg Address and then found in selected poetry and philosophy written at the time The nation is not just a government It is an organic entity a source of authority As Harlan repeats nearly thirty times in the course of his opinion the nation has liberated the slaves the nation has established universal freedom in this country and blacks denied citizenship in the Dred Scott decision acquired their equal citizenship in virtue of an affirmative grant from the nation Reasoning like Orestes Brownson or Frances Lieber Justice Harlan distinguished clearly between the nation and the federal or national government The nation is not a constituted government It is rather the source of authority that legitimates government This conception of nationhood synonymous with the spirit of Gettysburg is evident in expressions stressing the logical priority of the nations will For example Harland writes that to insure that the purposes of the nation might not be doubted or defeated the Fourteenth Amendment was proposed for adoption Equally poignant are passages that treat the rights and privileges of the Constitution as derived from the nation or that stress what the nation through Congress has sought to accomplish John Marshall Harlans entire philosophy expressing the heart of the Secret Constitution in dissent is summed up in this sentenceExemption from race discrimination in respect of the civil rights which are fundamental in citizenship in a republican government is as we have seen a new right created by the nation with express power in Congress by legislation to enforce the constitutional provision from which it is derived It is clear in this passage that the nation as distinct from government creates rights grants citizenship it has objectives that it seeks to accomplish but it must act through the prescribed processes of the law The nation acts initially in the process of constitutional amendment and then by means of delegated authority through the Congress The nation has expressed its will by precisely these means in the Reconstruction Amendments which delegated Congress authority to engage in the kind of legislation under attack in the Civil Rights Cases The logic of the argument traces the genesis of the nationstate First the nation comes into being as a prelegal organic unity and then the nation expresses itself in a governmental structureOne might properly inquire how the idea of the nations expressing its will differs from We the People acting in concert for the sake of a better government The differences are admittedly subtle Perhaps the accent in Justice Harlans mind was on the historical bond implied in the war that held the nation together Yet it is no accident that the expression We the People is absent in the rhetoric of his dissenting opinion The problem he addressed was not one that the people could decide for themselves The question Who constitutes the nation does not lend itself to democratic resolution The question of nationhood logically precedes both government and the popular will For the nation to express itself as government of the people it must first come into beingThe nation does not constitute itself by popular vote or by a decision of government The nation comes alive as Lincoln viewed our history as a bond forged in an historical struggle The bond was first cast in with the first stirring of independence or at the latest in July The inclusion of emancipated slaves within the nation came as the only consequence of the Brothers War that could make sense of the national search for redemptionRemarkably the eight justices who signed the Courts opinion invalidating the Civil Rights Act of used the vocabulary neither of peoplehood nor of nationhood They had no conception of the American nationor at least not one relevant to their legal analysis Of course they refer to the national government a phrase in which national is synonymous with federal or central Yet they use the term nation in reference to France I suppose that in the minds of the majority of justices the United States constituted not a nation but a people still living under the Constitution they had designed and ratified in the sNo one chose to create an American nation consisting of North and South white and black native and immigrant and there were undoubtedly many people displeased by the idea Yet this was the situation in which we found ourselves in Lincoln had conceived of rooting our history in the identity generated by the struggle for independence History had forged a unique nation of people of diverse origins Justice Harlan understood what the nation had become and what it could do to further its own internal harmony His magisterial dissent leaves us with a historical record of what constitutional thought in the postbellum period could have beenInstead of integrating our nationhood and the commitment to equality into constitutional discourse the Civil Rights Cases completed the process of driving Lincolns vision into the deep structure of our constitutional thought The Court generated a surface discourse to camouflage the Secret Constitution It bequeathed to us a narrow conception of state action that we are still struggling to overcome And more to the point by undermining federal authority to remove the incidents and marks of slavery the Court facilitated segregation in American society It would be a mere dozen or so years until the Supreme Court upheld the idea that public facilities including schools might be separate but equalthus institutionalizing apartheid for generations At the same time that the courts drove the postbellum legal order underground concerted action by the children of slave owners organized to frustrate the purposes of the Fifteenth Amendment Various measures including poll taxes literacy tests and organized violence were used to prevent African Americans from realizing their right to vote The Democratic Party gained the loyalty of white Southern voters and remained in power for more than half a century largely on the basis of segregationist principles Yet there is an important difference between the courts betraying the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments and the peoples frustrating the purposes of the Fifteenth Amendment With regard to the first two of the Reconstruction Amendments the courts gutted the great aspirations of the new constitutional order and led many professorial observers to teach that our Constitution really was what the segregationist courts said it was This tendency to take the Courts at face value derived largely from academic skepticism about the possibility of a higher law prevailing over the uses of judicial power in our understanding of what the Constitution really requiredThe Constitution became what the courts do in fact Legalism prevailed The legal philosophy of the Confederacy triumphed both in substance and in style The ideals of Gettysburg became for the lawyers in the second half of the nineteenth century a matter of history For the nation as a whole however the values of Gettysburgnationhood equality and democracyretained their promise and these principles would eventually return to the field of litigated lawAt least the commitment to democracy had begun to make inroads in the official documents of the lawyers The language of the Fifteenth Amendment the first federal measure directly securing a right to vote betokened the beginnings of popular democracy No state could deprive AfricanAmerican men of the right to voteat least in theory Missing was not the constitutional language but the will to enforce it The campaign to overcome impediments to black voting would take several generations including additional amendments and legislation abolishing poll taxes and literacy tests As the Secret Constitution would again reassert itself in American politics we would also take the promise of the Fifteenth Amendment seriouslyAs a sequel to World War II when black and white had again fought side by side although still in segregated units the will would again arise to fight for equality in a single nation It would take a campaign of restaurant sitins and bus boycotts finally to correct the great error of the Civil Rights Cases In fourscoreyearsandone after the initial defeat in the Supreme Court the country could once again say that equal access to theaters and public accommodations was the law of the landIf we look at the legacy of the Slaughterhouse Case and the Civil Rights Cases together we should note two additional casualties to the vision of a new postbellum legal order In the first case counsel raised the issue of economic discrimination which had never received due attention from the Supreme Court We turn in the next chapter to the legacy of that failure in ongoing economic discrimination in education As race came center stage in the truncated arena of equal protection the Supreme Court would ignore the tragedies of the states toleration of wealth and class discrimination As we shall see other countries have confronted the problem of wealth discrimination as an aspect of their commitment to equality It will eventually be incumbent on the Supreme Court to do the sameThe second major casualty was the concept of involuntary servitude as invoked in the Thirteenth Amendment Counsel tried but they could not persuade the Supreme Court to think of the burdens imposed on the New Orleans butchers and on African Americans subject to public segregation as variations of the servitudes prohibited by the Thirteenth Amendment That concept had the potential of inducing a new role for government in the relationships between private parties If servitudes should be understood as relationships of domination then an openended approach to the concept would have generated a watchdog role for the federal government in inspecting and supervising private relationships of potential exploitation and domination The Crescent City Companys domination of the independent butchers who had to pay tribute to practice the slaughtering trade should have been a paradigm of impermissible domination And the other paradigm of coerced servitude would have been the domination of blacks by whites in a segregated societyHad these two decisions gone the other way a triadic relationship with government would have emerged The triangle would have consisted in the potentially dominant private party the potentially subservient private party and the government as the guarantor of relationships of equality and nondomination It is not clear which branch of the federal government would have benefited most from a triadic relationship with private parties Congress would have exercised its authority to legislate under the Thirteenth Amendment The executive would have established commissions to keep tabs on relationships that came to public attention Although the judiciary probably would have prospered as well the Supreme Court of the s and s did not want to see the federal government become the watchdog of economic and semipublic racial relationships Our history took a different course one that required us to confront in ways that we hardly expected the moral difficulties of understanding equality under law In recent years the Secret Constitution has come to assert itself in the opinions particularly the dissenting opinions of the Supreme Court If we are to understand the impact of our implicit postbellum commitment to the ideas of nationhood democracy and equality we cannot limit ourselves to the jurisprudence of the nine justices who happen to sit on the Court in Washington The Secret Constitution has in fact a much deeper grounding in American political and legal culture and it has come to express itself in diverse arenas It spontaneously percolates through civil society It shapes the process of constitutional amendment indeed virtually every constitutional amendment enacted since the Civil War expresses in one way or another the values of the Secret Constitution This is true as well of the two leading proposed constitutional amendments that have gained a large political following in the last decade the proposal to protect the flag against desecration and the movement to protect victims of crime The values of the Secret Constitution have also found their way into subconstitutional federal legislation based as a technical matter on the Interstate Commerce Clause granting Congress authority to regulate commerce among the states The earlier defeat in the Supreme Court of the Civil Rights Act of meant that Congress had to find other means of bringing to bear the same set of values in the pursuit of equal treatment in public facilities and in the workplace In order to see the resurgence of the three great ideas of the Secret Constitutionnationhood democracy and equalitywe have to look afield away from the courts to these diverse areas that give birth to legal trends and define the bedrock of the American ConstitutionConstitutional AmendmentsOf all the arenas in which the Secret Constitution has come to the fore none is more impressive than the process of constitutional amendment All of the amendments adopted and ratified over the last years reveal the traces of a shared understanding an unconscious plan of what American government should be like This is a remarkable thesis for the general tendency is to assume that the amendments consist in a hodgepodge of special responses to unrelated problemsThe dominant theme is the spread of the franchise and the finetuning of the system of democratic representation But there are other strains from the Secret Constitution as well As we work our way through the amendments from the Thirteenth to the TwentySeventh we shall also see a countervailing principle at work Democracy stresses the responsibility of the people for their selfgovernance The offsetting principle is that the government must be strong well financed and act with a sense of compassion for the weak and defenseless Our postbellum commitment to democracy is well known Less well appreciated is the deep American sense of concern for those who are not able to fend for themselves The final implication then of the Secret Constitution is the commitment of government to the dignity and selfesteem of all its citizensIf we think of the Civil War as a moral drama we cannot but perceive a government at work that is committed to the dignity of all The drama can be narrowly understood as an enormous sacrifice of human life to liberate people held in the most demeaning condition imaginable The war snuffed out one life one being created in the image of God for every seven slaves freed There might have been a less costly way of solving the problem Simply waiting and negotiating we might have seen the market itself render the keeping of slaves too costly an enterprise Industrialization spreading South might have made free labor a more appealing alternative for those who profited from the system of slave labor The end of plantation capitalism might have come as safely as the demise of communism in Europe But these possible scenarios are beside the point The sacrifice did occur And we thought it was necessary as Lincoln preached to cleanse us of our offences and to give the nation a new birth of freedom We could not have survived this drama with anything but a sense that government was capable of a great moral undertaking Government was no longer instituted simply to keep the peace deliver the mail and protect us from foreign enemies but also to ensure that we not descend into the kind of evil that seared the soul of the first American Republic The period of the Civil War witnessed legislative measures that had never been seen before in the United Statesthe beginning of a national banking system the issuance of a national currency a homestead act that distributed acres to each settler and land grants for building universities We incorporated this new understanding of government into the Thirteenth Amendment which declared boldly that the particular kind of evil that had led to war would never again exist in the United States To prevent this reoccurrence the federal government would have to be strong and vigilant It would have to observe the transactions that occurred in the marketplace to ensure that they did not approach the danger zone of involuntary servitude The war itself and this consequent postbellum policy of necessary vigilance laid the foundation for the later expressions of compassion for the weak and defenselessFrom the Thirteenth to the Fifteenth Amendment however from to we can sense a sharp decline in the moral energy of government Section of the Fourteenth Amendment contains of course the invocations of privileges and immunities due process and equal protection that have engaged the Supreme Court and its academic commentators But implicit in this amendment is the resurgence of the states responsibility for the events that occur within their borders And Sections and of the amendment contain timespecific provisions designed to penalize the disloyal states and rebel soldiers and officials These vengeful provisions have caused much mischief as we have seen by providing fodder today for those who prefer denying the franchise to convicted felons Still the equal protection clause was a breakthrough and supplied the anchor for a cardinal principle of the postbellum legal order And the due process clause would prove to be the umbrella that would enable the Supreme Court in the last halfcentury to develop a jurisprudence of human rights that applies to the entire countryThe framing of the Fifteenth Amendment suffered from the loss of moral ambition Congress could have drafted the amendment simply to require the franchise for all persons above the age of But that would have required a clear rationale for the democratic franchise a clear principle telling us who should vote and why At the most we had a vague commitment to the new idea of democracy for the entire nation of Americans The womens suffrage movement had begun but it had little support And it was not at all clear that emancipated slaves would receive the vote Democrats were naturally fearful that the newly enfranchised blacks would vote for the party that promoted their liberation Republicans in Congress pressed both for the vote for former slaves and for the disenfranchisement of disloyal members of the Confederacy A new coalition they hoped would break the power of the landed lite and bring about a social revolution in the South President Johnson himself identified with the class of small white farmers in Tennessee who felt threatened by the potential rise of black political power in the SouthThese political considerations played themselves out against ambivalent sentiments about who constituted the people in government of the people by the people for the people Yet we should not underappreciate the radical step of granting the franchise to emancipated slaves on the same terms as it was available to the rest of the population This transformation of a slave population was unique in the history of revolutionary wars The concept of popular democracy was beginning to take root We should not forget that despite pretensions of a democratic founding in the idea that more than a dominant lite should vote was as foreign to the mind of the late eighteenth century as were the terms American nation and equality Rule by the demos or the nation was like equality still unfolding as a way of life It had no guiding theoryno rationale and no historical model It was not at all obvious that the uneducated propertyless masses should govern the countryThe entire constitutional structure drafted in needed revamping but without a compelling theory to guide them the political powers in Congress settled for the modest demand in the Fifteenth Amendment that the states not deny the franchise on account of race color or previous condition of servitude It is hard to imagine a lesser demand on the states consistent with the policy of treating the emancipated slaves as members of the nation with equal political rightsThe ensuing amendments also pursue the principles latent in the Secret Constitution The Sixteenth Amendment ratified after a lapse of fortyfive years recognized the legitimacy of the income tax The government had already experimented with the income tax during the Civil War and enacted another tax in the s The Supreme Court initially upheld the imposition of an income tax but then in the Court vetoed five votes to four the new aspirations of the federal government The rationale for the Courts intervention was an obscure provision on direct and indirect taxes in the Constitution of that had gotten in the way of the new vision of governmentThe Seventeenth Amendment brings us back to the process of developing a democratic system of government Henceforth senators would have to be elected not by state legislatures but directly by the people The tone of the amendment remains deferential to the states control of the electoral process even for national office The text does not tell us that all people over the age of twentyone should be entitled to vote but leaves it up to each state to decide who shall be able to vote for the most numerous branch of the state legislature Whatever that standard happens to be will prevail as well for elections to the United States SenateThe Eighteenth Amendment is the most significant of the lot for once again we witness in action a government solicitous of the welfare of its people The structure of this amendment is exactly the same as the Thirteenth As the latter declares that a certain form of private relationship of subordination shall not exist in the United States the Eighteenth Amendment tells us analogously that another private relationship shall not occur the manufacture sale or transportation of intoxicating liquors within the United States is hereby prohibited This much misunderstood amendment ratified in expressed a collective concern for the dignity and welfare of all those whose lives were destroyed by drink Of course we know that it did not work but the sentiment expressed was a noble one It reflects a politics of mutual responsibility in a single nation a concern for those who could easily get lost in the rough and tumble of capitalist AmericaWe encounter this noble motive at work and see its failure in our current policy toward the sale and use of narcotics We deploy vast sums and personnel in an effort to halt the spread of drug usage although it is hard to see any tangible payoff from our investment The reason is simple It is not easy for government to interdict the pleasures of those who can satisfy them through purely private transactions The level of vigilance required exceeds the capacity of government in a society that also seeks to protect privacy and civil libertiesIn the case of liquor in particular Prohibition had the effect of making consumption tantalizing and exciting The speakeasy the drink on the sly the home brewall these brought extra pleasure to those who imbibed The effect of Prohibition was much the same as in the case of flag burning The laws forbidding the act makes it more thrilling The effect is just the opposite of that intendedTherein lies a message for the politics of governmental intervention There are times when we must rely on civil society to achieve our goalssometimes with a slight nudge from government Witness the turnaround that has occurred in the United States with regard to cigarette smoking The government posted health warnings on cigarette packs required airlines and governmental buildings to ban smoking but did not try to follow the model of Prohibition or the drug laws The policy of deferring to voluntary initiative has been more effective A revolution in attitudes toward smoking has occurred largely because people were free in effect to decide for themselves in their homes offices and other spheres of influence They did not need the coercive force of government behind themFor many the limitations on governmental power represent a trivial and selfevident proposition But those who believe in the power of government as I do should pay heed And conservatives who are generally skeptical of the power of government would do well to ponder the analogies between Prohibition and the drive for prayer in the schools or the criminalization of flag burning Of course there are some areas such as the protection of the victims of crime where only the government can act Of that problem there will be more to say laterAllow me to take the TwentyFirst Amendment out of order After a decade of Prohibition the country realized in that the government simply could not act upon its noble motives The Constitution had to be amended once more this time to countermand the Eighteenth Amendment Some states for example Mississippi retained Prohibition for many more years As a colleague from ostensibly dry Mississippi once jibed Prohibition is better than no liquor at all The country as a whole finally decided however that a little liquor was more desirable than the costs to freedom in trying to achieve ProhibitionThe rest of the amendments beginning with the Nineteenth are all directed to the process of spreading the franchise and refining the mechanism of democratic representation The Nineteenth the TwentyFourth and the TwentySixth Amendments all serve the purpose of extending the franchise The drafting style follows the Fifteenth Amendment by specifying the criterion on account of which the states may not limit or abridge the right to vote By using this negative formulation the first of the series finally extends suffrage to women the second to those who have not paid a poll tax or any other tax required to vote and the third to all men and women over the age of Also in this group is the TwentyThird Amendment which extends the right to vote for the president and vice president to citizens otherwise qualified in the District of ColumbiaThese amendments bespeak the philosophical principles of the Secret Constitution A clear commitment to a universal right to vote finally takes hold The franchise attaches not to those with qualifications education wealth age or even the supposed superiority that according to the attitudes of men enjoyed in practical affairs The franchise belongs to all Americans and even to resident noncitizens who are capable of knowing in the minimal theory of democratic voting when the shoe pinches Lincolns vision of government by all the people was becoming the law of the landAlso elections for the presidency begin to take on the quality of a national referendum in place of a compilation of preferences by the individual states People started voting and expressing themselves as the voice of the nation Thus it came to be obvious that citizens of the country who did not reside in the states namely those in the federal district must also have the right to vote for national offices The Constitution nominally retained the electoral college as a way of giving lip service to the states but it is clear that the popular vote expresses the will of the nation This became clear in the presidential election of discussed in detail in the Afterword On the basis of the results certified on November Governor George W Bush acquired a one vote majority in the electoral college Vice President Gores persistent legal challenge to the certified result depended in part on the sense of legitimacy he acquired from winning the confidence of the nation in the popular voteThe remaining constitutional amendments finetune the workings of Congress and the presidency The Twentieth shortens the lameduck period between the November election and the change of leadership in the following year Previously the inauguration was prescribed for the beginning of March but the amendment moved up the date to January for Congress and January for the presidency Although this amendment appears simply to address matters of the calendar it came into play recently in the dispute about whether an outgoing lameduck House of Representatives could in the period between election and going out of office constitutionally impeach President Clinton Bruce Ackerman shocked the Capital by testifying before the House that the newly seated Senate could not constitutionally try the president on an impeachment passed by the outgoing House The amendment also authorizes Congress to prescribe a mode of succession to the presidency between electionsThe TwentySecond Amendment limits the term of office of the president to two fouryear terms plus a maximum of two years inherited from a predecessor unable to complete his term And the TwentyFifth regulates in detail the problem of transition when the president is still alive but incapable of executing the office The last amendment the TwentySeventh prohibits congressionally legislated pay raises from taking effect until another national election has taken place and a new Congress is sworn in This last revision of the national charter also testifies to the theme of improving the workings of popular democracy the people must be consulted before their elected representatives should be allowed to raise their own salaries The curious twist in this last addition to the Constitution is that although it was finally ratified by threefourths of the states in it was originally proposed by James Madison two hundred years earlier Its formal roots lie in the original Constitution of The amendments to the original Constitution all bespeak the same pattern of realizing the implicit postbellum commitment to nationhood democracy and equality The realization of these values in the amendments bespeaks the resurgence of the Secret ConstitutionCompassion for VictimsThe structure of our basic rights favors those who actthose who speak assemble worship carry guns keep their homes private or stretch their liberties to the point that the state charges them with criminal offenses The attention paid to the rights of criminal defendants in the Bill of Rights is extraordinary The Fourth Fifth Sixth and Eighth Amendments address the rights of suspects defendants and those convicted of crime Noticeably absent in this catalogue of rights is due regard for those who suffer from the constitutionally protected actions of others Our liberties entail costs but for some reason the human beings who bear these costs are left outside of the constitutional equation The victims have no rights They are mentioned nowhereIndifference toward the victim began to change with the Thirteenth Amendment For the first time the people who must bear the cross of involuntary servitude became the focus of attention They would no longer suffer in the United States The federal government had the duty to protect them The government also asserted its duty to protect the weak in the Prohibition Amendment but alas the duty to help others is not always easily realized Yet the idea that the government should protect the weak that it should tender compassion for victims became a mainstay of the Secret ConstitutionOf course no one is constitutionally protected in the action of committing a crime The rights attach to those suspected of crime The purpose of the amendments is to insure both that innocent persons will not be convicted but just as critically to protect the dignity of every suspect as he or she falls under the investigative and prosecuting power of the state For example the privilege against selfincrimination goes beyond the protection of the innocent to speak to the dignity of the suspect who may remain silent Similarly the protection of the home and private papers often deters the efficiency of law enforcement but only for the sake of promoting personal privacy So long as we recognize that the constitutional provisions are interlaced with dignity concerns then we cannot properly disregard the claims of victims to be treated in the same way The victims rights movement focuses therefore on increasing the participation of victims in various stages of the process Participation itself helps enhance the dignity of the victim by allowing him or her to be heard and to feel respected as a citizenThe most common problem faced by victims is that they are not allowed to attend the trials of those who have allegedly assaulted or raped them or killed members of their families The trial of Timothy McVeigh for bombing the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in and killing people provides dramatic proof of indifference to discrimination against the interests of victims First federal Judge Richard Matsch changed the venue of the trial from Oklahoma City to Denver which of course made it much more difficult for the murdered victims families to attend the trial The nominal reason for the change of venue was that McVeigh was more likely to receive an unbiased jury in a city several hundred miles away The likelihood of finding potential jurors in Denver or anywhere else in the United States unaffected by the intensive media coverage of the bombing was thought to be minimal The other factor influencing the judges decision to relocate the trial in Denver was the politely undiscussed fact that he owned a ranch outside of Denver It suited his personal interests to be close to homeIf the change of venue was not bad enough Judge Matsch also banned the victims who braved the journey from sitting in the courtroom during the trial Many courts require witnesses to wait outside if they are likely to be called later in the trial but in this case the defense prevailed on the judge to bar the victims families on the ground that their very presence might induce an emotional response in the jury This decision we might say represented the nadir of compassion for victims in the United States Finally Congress intervened to guarantee victims who have suffered direct physical emotional or financial harm the right to observe the trial by closed circuit televisionA more compassionate approach to victims rights became evident in the famous O J Simpson case which held the countrys rapt attention for more than a year in and In the pretrial skirmishes the defense objected to the families of the two victims Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman remaining in the courtroom if they might later be called as witnesses Marcia Clark won the argument in the name of the Brown and Goldman families actually with some help from a book I had just published on victims rights Whether his words did the trick or not the author could not help but enjoy hearing them enter into the deliberations As Clark read them in the debate The minimal task of the criminal trial is to stand by victims to restore their dignity to find a way for them to think of themselves once again as men and women equal to all others Judge Ito made the right decision to let the families stay in court If they were later called as witnesses the defense could adequately protect itself by crossexamining the witnesses about testimony previously heardEuropean courts are also wary of allowing potential witnesses to hear the testimony of other witnesses before they testify they put less faith in crossexamination but they take strong measures to protect the interests of victims at trial The typical pattern is to allow the victim to join the proceedings either as a civil plaintiff suing simultaneously for tort damages or as a coprosecutor arguing and presenting the case alongside the state prosecutor American reformers want to improve the position of the victim at trial but none of them dares go so far as to suggest reforms comparable to accepted practice on the ContinentThe American movement favoring compassion for victims of crime has found expression in a variety of lowvisibility measures The constitutional amendment sponsored by Senators Jon Kyl of Arizona and Diane Feinstein of California sought to introduce the following rightsTo be notified of the proceedingsTo attend all public proceedingsTo be heard at certain crucial stages in the processTo be notified of the offenders release or escapeTo consideration for a trial free from unreasonable delayTo an order of restitutionTo have the safety of the victim considered in determining a release from custodyTo be notified of these rights and to have standing to enforce themSo far as it goes the proposed amendment makes sense It expresses the spirit of compassion rooted in the Secret Constitution It expresses the same sentiments that led to other initiatives to protect the weak and defenseless Although each of the constitutional efforts to intervene on behalf of the powerless has a different impulse and a different agenda they all spring from a root concern for those who are not strong enough to act for themselves This is the common thread that begins in the Thirteenth Amendment peaks perhaps wrongly in Prohibition and issues today into the movement to stand by victims to restore their dignity to find a way for them to think of themselves once again as men and women equal to all othersThe opposition to victims rights stems from both prosecutors and defense counsel The former do not want victims complicating the trial They are surely opposed to my proposal that victims be able to veto plea bargains and insist on going to trial to vindicate their charges Prosecutors generally like to have victims around at the sentencing phase The suffering and rage of the victims when expressed in court tends to spike the punishment Defense counsel are opposed for other reasons They are afraid that empowering victims will distract from the rights of criminal defendants but this is not necessarily the case The victims interest is primarily in participating in the trial He or she may communicate a desire for conviction but that parochial sentiment of interest will be readily discounted by the commonsense responses of the jury The fact is that it is possible to strengthen the participatory rights of victims without unduly complicating the procedure or compromising the traditional rights of the defenseCivil SocietyThe central question in any movement of compassion is whether the government is the best agency of reform There are obviously some areas where we must rely on the government or on no one Only the federal government could have waged the Civil War and emancipated the powerless Only the federal government could secure the franchise to those who had no power on the local level Only the federal courts can secure equal protection of the laws when the states decide to disfavor some of their citizens But in other areas of life the government can further its ends by staying its handThe US government has sought to maintain the religious sensibility that brought forth the Declaration of Independence but was abandoned in the secular Constitution of Americans have become and remained one of the most religious nations on earth and largely because the state has evolved toward a rigorous policy of symbolic support for religion at the same time insisting that the religious culture either thrive or die on its own The symbolic gestures include printing IN GOD WE TRUST on our money celebrating two Christian holidays as national holidays and using the Bible in oathtaking ceremonies These are significant public gestures in a society that rigorously forbids the states spending money to support religious education Amusingly the Court even quotes the Great Maxim from the Secret Constitutionall men are created equalto support the separation of Church and State These postures seem to be the mirror opposite of European practices where the state readily provides subsidies for religious schools but would not consider using religious symbols on its money or even using the Bible in court to administer the oath to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth Whether these differences in practice are determinative or not it is clear that the United States has remained a more deeply religious country than Germany France or even Italy For religious faith to remain strong it might be better for the state to keep its distanceThe same could be said of devotion to the nation The state must engage in some elementary gestures of national pride It must define and disseminate a flag a national anthem and celebrate holidays such as the Fourth of July Veterans Day and the birthdays of great national leaders Nations that fail to do these things have trouble melding their people into a single culture of national identity A good example is Israel which has yet to find a holiday that Jews and Arabs can celebrate together We live in a time of national disintegrationwitness Czechoslovakia the Soviet Union and the nearmisses in Canadaand therefore the state is properly advised to cultivate a common identity and a sense of shared history and destinySince the Civil War the United States has hardly lacked a strong sense of national patriotism But the state has had to do little to further it In the s the Pledge of Allegiance our secular prayer to the flag spontaneously spread across the country and became a standard part of the socialization process for all American children There was little national hesitation about our wars of national aggrandizement against militarily weak opponents in Cuba and Panama And the country joined enthusiastically in sending our doughboys overseas in President Wilsons words to make the world safe for democracy The generation that fought and won World War II is still with us infusing in both blacks and whites a strong sense of a national mission well executed The war in Vietnam was undoubtedly a setback for the spirit of patriotism A whole generationmy friends and studentsbecame skeptical about the use of military power Yet to my surprise and somewhat to my chagrin a new cohort took up the sentiments of their grandparents and enthusiastically supported the questionable goals of the government in the Gulf War As we were bombing Iraq the country erupted again in a spontaneous display of unity and patriotic enthusiasm Yellow ribbons appeared everywhere It reminded one of the pledge that burst out a hundred years earlier a paean to the flag in school houses around the countryCivil society is a powerful medium and when the public takes up the cause either of religion or of patriotism its strength overshadows the feeble efforts of government to manipulate its opinions Yet in both fieldsreligion and patriotismwe face a constant challenge from those who are unsatisfied with the successes of civil society They want government to join the action Nowhere is this more evident than in the politics of schooling We worry constantly perhaps with good reason that the young in America are growing up with the wrong values They supposedly suffer from all the mistakes of their elders who promote violence on television and have permitted the country to be flooded with guns which as everyone knows enable teenagers who go on rampages to gain a few hours of prime time news coverage One wonders however whether it is an effective response for government to require as suggested in one Republican initiative schools to post the Ten Commandments on schoolhouse walls This drive toward governmental intervention in the field of value formation has been nowhere more evidentand questionablethan the recently revived push for a constitutional amendment to protect the flag against protestors who want to burn itThe commitment to the flag has surely been one of the stable and recognized provisions of our sub rosa constitution We do well to cultivate reverence toward the flag which coupled with national rituals like the pledge instills sentiments of national loyalty in our children Although patriotic sentiments toward the flag antedate the Civil War we begin to find in the early twentieth century a duty of reverence toward the Stars and Stripes formulated as a legal issue In the Supreme Court upheld the conviction for flag desecration of a beer manufacturer who printed the flag on his cans Appropriating the flag for commercial purposes was considered disrespectfulOur attitudes toward the flag were then so obeisant that we adopted religious language to describe acts of disrespect toward Old Glory It would be difficult to say that piece of cloth on which the stars and stripes were printed was ever consecrated so that it could be desecrated These terms imply the ritual use of an object exclusively for worshiping God Despite the inappropriate use of religious language the Supreme Court upheld this crime as a sensible expression of governments instinct to protect the symbols of the nationBut then the commitment to national pride ran into a contrary trend in American thought that had been in the process of emergence for over a century The impulse to protect the flag against desecration confronted the rising devotion to the cardinal American value of free speech Since World War I and the dissenting opinion of Justices Holmes and Brandeis the American recognition of the primacy of free speech has been on an upward trajectory The Supreme Court including its most conservative justices has consistently favored the primacy of speech over the interests of victims injured or offended by the rough and ready rumble of the marketplace of ideasThe collision was inevitable Two American ideasprotecting the flag and celebrating freedom of speechwould eventually come into focus as contradictory ways of being American It was a close battle but in two sharply divided votes of the s the Supreme Court decided that freedom of expression must prevail But this was hardly a defeat for the politics of national sentiment Those who loved the flag still had recourse to civil society The proponents of patriotic rituals such as honoring the flag could learn from the history of religious sensibility in the United States The government cannot coerce religious observance without as John Locke argued in his first Letter Concerning Toleration corrupting the act of faith into an empty gesture of external compliance The opposite effect occurs when the government seeks to punish those who burn the flag The punitive sanction enhances the communicative sting of flag burning The simple act of destroying a piece of cloth becomes a major event watched closely by the police and the media The subsequent trial of the flag burner gives him or her a platform for broadcasting the political views expressed in the illegal act At one time burning the flag was something like wearing a jacket in the courthouse blazoned with the words Fuck the Draft But when flag burning becomes an acceptable and potentially routine event it draws no more attention than the use of fourletter words at cocktail partiesThere is no doubt that free speech has its victims and in most European societies and in Canada the courts rush in to protect the victims against being offended A good example is the way every major jurisdiction outside the United States treats Holocaust denial Someone publishes a book saying that Auschwitz never happened that it is a lie propagated by the Jews This is a punishable act in Germany France Israel the Netherlands Canadajust about everywhere where people believe that the government must intervene in order to protect those who might be disturbed and offended by the obscene lie By intervening and putting the Holocaust denier on trial of course they only broadcast the lie to a larger audience and they convert the mad dissident into a martyr in his own circleThe Supreme Court has remained remarkably unaffected by the academic swing toward support for hate speech legislation In the RAV case for example the Court struck down a municipal ordinance that punished the display of a symbol that one knows or has reason to know arouses anger alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race color creed religion or gender Academic critics of the decision stress the value of regulating speech that has the effect it is argued of silencing minorities The overriding value they claim is the equality of those affected by hate speech Only by restricting intimidating speech the argument goes can all potential participants in the democratic dialogue feel free to speak and to make their opinions known In the courts however the ancien principles still reign The primary value is not equality but freedomBut the governments staying its hand does not mean that hate speech goes unsanctioned Civil society has it own spontaneous means of chastising those who veer too far from the acceptable range of discourse The best remedy against the Auschwitz lie as the Germans call it is to ignore it Deborah Lipstadt in her book Denying the Holocaust wrote that we should not publicly debate unacceptable as well as obviously false claims and thus she advanced a remedy as powerful as governmental censorship When civil society turns a deaf ear crazy ideas lose their edge The remedy disturbed one historian labeled a denier so much that in late he unsuccessfully sued Lipstadt for libel primarily to force her to confront his claimsIn other areas where racist and sexist speech wounds the spontaneous order of American society has been uncannily effective in changing patterns of speech Consider the careful choice of words in this book I do not write Negro or colored as people were wont to do not long ago Black and African American have become the norm and it all happened without governments uttering a sound When governmental officials try to tell people how to talk they look slightly ridiculous Witness the French trying to outlaw the use of the word cheeseburger and other insidious harbingers of American culture However strong the value of preserving the French language in all its purity the task is not one for government At a certain point we have to trust the unplanned powerful forces of civil societyHuman DignityBut civil society is not always to be trusted Witness the drive toward a constitutional amendment to protect the flag against physical desecration The amendment actually passed the House of Representatives in the summer of but it is not expected to command the necessary twothirds vote in the Senate When speech induces a sense of victimization in minorities and women many academics in the United States and even more lawmakers abroad reach for the arsenal of legal remedies to show their compassion for victims Two basic strategies present themselves One technique trades heavily on the values of the Secret Constitution and the other characteristic of German thought relies heavily on the Kantian concept of human dignity The general principle of equal treatment as we have elaborated it lends itself to the argument for limiting freedom of speech The claim is that obscenity degrades women and thus fails to treat them equally with the men who are interested in consuming the obscene material Similarly hate speech systematically degrades its targets and therefore treats them as unworthy of equal status in society These are good arguments that draw on a long tradition of concern in the theory of equality for protecting the weak and defenselessThe alternative mode of compassionate jurisprudence relies on the concept of human dignity elaborated in Article of the German Basic Law of The term human dignity is not defined in the Basic Law and therefore the courts must rely on the basic Kantian principles that human dignity expresses the ultimate personhood of each individual In my view although we have never expressed a principle of human dignity in American constitutional law the same principle underlies our commitment to the Great Maxim Our notion of equalityincreation derives from the view that we are all of ultimate value an idea that can be expressed either by going back to the biblical idea of creation in the image of God or taking the secular alternative of human dignity beyond all price as articulated in Kants moral theoryTo see how the notion of human dignity operates in practice let us take a look at the wellknown Peep Show case decided in by the Federal Administrative Court Bundesverwaltungsgericht in Germany The operators of a peep show were denied a business permit because their show supposedly violated the morals of the community Their show displayed a naked woman on a circulating round stage viewed by men in private booths equipped with oneway windows The women could not see the men who were gawking at their genitalia and the men could not see each other The Federal Administrative Court upheld the denial of the license on the ground that the show violated the human dignity of the women who chose to participate That participation was voluntary was irrelevant for the state had an absolute duty under Article to protect human dignity whether the victims wanted the help or notThe courts rationale for the decision traded heavily on the Kantian principle that no one should ever use another person exclusively as a means to an end The judges had no objection to striptease performances which they regarded as a variation on dancing in front of an interactive public But the oneway nature of the viewing in this case disturbed the courtBy contrast with a strip tease the women in the peep show are subjected to a humiliating objectifying role brought about by a number of factors the automatic way in which the viewers pay for the opening of the peep window in which the viewing of the naked woman resembles buying a product from a vending machine the oneway windows that leave the women without eye contact as the isolated objects of salacious desire and the voyeurs relegated to their secret cabinsOne has to think twice before rejecting this argument This is not simple prudery The fact is that the entire enterprise does degrade the participating women into mere objects and though one could imagine a woman enjoying doing a striptease to an appreciative bunch of unruly sailors the anonymity of private sexual gratification could leave one with a sense of humanity abandoned Yet there is obviously another point of view The selfexposure of the woman on the rotating stage is not that much different from doing a striptease before a television camera The audience is invisible each viewer is in his little cubicle called a living room The danger in the argument of human dignity is that it carries the risk of dogmatism In the face of the conviction that the peep show violates the dignity of the women who choose to participate there is little one can sayAt least one German feminist favors the American approach of treating the problem in the Peep Show case as one of equality rather than human dignity The participation of the woman may seem voluntary on the surface But the mandate of equal justice for men and women requires that we inquire whether in light of the existing power structure the participation of the women is really voluntary Appearances deceive The argument of dignity begins and ends with the question whether the work reduces women to the status of objects The perspective of equality by contrast encourages a broader political inquiry into the relations between women and men in the arenas of sex and money The feminist assumption apparently is that in a state of true equality no one would agree to engage in this kind of selfhumiliation for pay To be sure however that the work is so degrading we must make implicit judgments about the kinds of activities that allow our sense of humanity to flourish We are invariably drawn back to the Kantian theory of human dignityWhether we approach the problem of sexual exploitation as a problem of dignity or of equality we can see the politics of compassion at work The society as a whole undertakes to protect the selfworth of those who fall prey to superior forces We have made the transition from governmental intervention to prevent slavery to a collective responsibility for the welfare of each Perhaps Americans would not interfere with the appearance of autonomy in the peep show But we took aggressive measures during Prohibition to protect individuals against the selfdegradation of alcoholism and we intervene today in a mammoth and seemingly unproductive campaign to protect people against drug abuseThe paradox of the American approach toward equality is that though we trail European societies in our concern about economic equality and wealth discrimination we lead the world in other areas of egalitarian thinking The Secret Constitution has emerged with vigor in our collective effort to curtail sexual harassment and discrimination against women in the work place The movement has occurred at the level of federal law particularly in the interpretation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act The public often forgets that the expansion of sexual harassment law is grounded in the simple commitment to overcome gender inequality in the workplace The law has moved so quickly in this arena that most men and women no longer know when and how they can approach a coworker and make a compliment or request a date President Clinton even paid a ransom of to avoid an appeal in a sexual harassment dispute in which the law and the lower court judgment seemed clearly on his side Whatever the merits of this body of law there is little doubt that Americans stand responsible for exporting this vision of sexual equality on the job and even for the creation of a new vocabulary of sexuelle Belstigung and harclement sexuel necessary to discuss the problemThe redress of sexual harassment should be understood in part as an expression of the egalitarian aspirations of the Secret Constitution Yet as a symptom of the times sexual harassment also represents a new vision of government it has developed against the background of growing skepticism about whether things really are what they seemEquality for Believers and NonbelieversThe values of the second constitution continue to collide with those of the first The egalitarian approach toward freedom of religion dictates a leveling of two conflicting clauses in the First Amendment on freedom of religion One clause prescribes establishment of religion the other mandates the free exercise of religion For the past thirty years or so the tendency has been to read these two clauses together to prohibit both the state financing of religious activities and the states favoring one religion by granting to believers special exemptions from the laws applicable to everyone The opposition claims that religious reasons warrant exceptional treatment say for refusing to work on ones personal Sabbath for using hallucinatory drugs or for keeping ones children out of school in violation of truancy laws Again the conflict is between equality and freedom Equality requires that all be treated alikeno exceptions for those motivated by fear of God The faithful object and insist on the teaching found in Matthew Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesars and unto God the things that are Gods The constitutional right to freedom of religion they argue requires special exemptions for those who dissent as a matter of conscience from the laws applicable to othersWhile the judicial proponents of freedom continue to hold the upper hand on free speech the reigning approach to freedom of religion underscores the evenhandedness of the lawthe same rules should apply to religious and nonreligious alike In in Oregon v Smith the majority of the Court held that this egalitarian approach to religion should govern the cases of some Native Americans who claimed the right to use peyote in their religious services Their goodfaith claim for exceptional treatment did not prevail in the face of the general prohibition against peyote as a drug perceived to be dangerous In order to reach this conclusion the Court had to push aside a line of precedents recognizing a policy of deference to any who refused as a matter of religious conscience to comply with the laws of the stateCongress responded to Smiths egalitarian treatment of religion by enacting the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of The purpose was to restore the earlier jurisprudence of the Court and to provide a claim or defense to persons whose religious exercise is substantially burdened by government The supposed ground for Congresss overruling a constitutional decision of the Supreme Court was Section of the Fourteenth Amendment The proponents of the statute thus relied upon a provision of the second constitution to defend a conception of freedom rooted in the First Amendment and the first Constitution When the case reached the Supreme Court six justices found that Congress had exceeded its authority under the Fourteenth Amendment The spirit of the decision dovetails well with the Courts decision in to overturn the first civil rights acts as an excessive claim of congressional authorityThe decision reflects a general tendency of the Supreme Court to suppress the independent significance of the second constitution If the postbellum constitutional order were taken seriously as an independent source of constitutional law its legislative provisions would be construed as liberally as the grants of legislative authority under the interstate commerce clause and the other provisions of Article I defining the power of Congress in the old Constitution Yet the Courts attitude toward legislative authority under the Fourteenth Amendment begins on the assumption of fear Congress should be able to implement the due process and equal protection clauses but not engage in imaginative interpretations of what these clauses should mean in practice In defense of the current Supreme Court however we should note the extraordinary claim that Congress should have the authoritywherever it might be locatedexplicitly to overrule a constitutional decision of the Supreme Court Recognizing congressional authority for this purpose would destabilize the structure of judicial review as it has evolved since the early nineteenth century and therefore the conservative inclination of the Court has much to commend itOne cannot but be impressed by the postmodern style of the Courts resolution of this constitutional crisis about freedom of religion The Supreme Court relies on egalitarian thinkinga value drawn from the second constitutionto develop an approach to the conflicting clauses on religion in the First Amendment Congress seeks to return to an interpretation of religious liberty attributed to the first Constitution but grounds its authority in the Fourteenth Amendment the cornerstone of the second constitution The Court parries in the name of equality by cabining and curtailing the legislative authority that could be used to further the egalitarian values of the Fourteenth Amendment Chapter Prolegomenon to a General Biologyecturing in Dublin one of the twentieth centurys most famous physicists set the stage of contemporary biology during the warheavy year of Given Erwin Schrdingers towering reputation as the discoverer of the Schrdinger equation the fundamental formulation of quantum mechanics his public lectures and subsequent book were bound to draw high attention But no one not even Schrdinger himself was likely to have foreseen the consequences Schrdingers What Is Life is credited with inspiring a generation of physicists and biologists to seek the fundamental character of living systems Schrdinger brought quantum mechanics chemistry and the still poorly formulated concept of information into biology He is the progenitor of our understanding of DNA and the genetic code Yet as brilliant as was Schrdingers insight I believe he missed the center Investigations seeks that center and finds in fact a mysteryIn my previous two books I laid out some of the growing reasons to think that evolution was even richer than Darwin supposed Modern evolutionary theory based on Darwins concept of descent with heritable variations that are sifted by natural selection to retain the adaptive changes has come to view selection as the sole source of order in biological organisms But the snowflakes delicate sixfold symmetry tells us that order can arise without the benefit of natural selection Origins of Order and At Home in the Universe give good grounds to think that much of the order in organisms from the origin of life itself to the stunning order in the development of a newborn child from a fertilized egg does not reflect selection alone Instead much of the order in organisms I believe is selforganized and spontaneous Selforganization mingles with natural selection in barely understood ways to yield the magnificence of our teeming biosphere We must therefore expand evolutionary theoryYet we need something far more important than a broadened evolutionary theory Despite any valid insights in my own two books and despite the fine work of many others including the brilliance manifest in the past three decades of molecular biology the core of life itself remains shrouded from view We know chunks of molecular machinery metabolic pathways means of membrane biosynthesiswe know many of the parts and many of the processes But what makes a cell alive is still not clear to us The center is still mysteriousAnd so I began my notebook Investigations in December of a full half century after Schrdingers What Is Life as an intellectual enterprise unlike any I had undertaken before Rather bravely and thinking with some presumptuousness of Wittgensteins famous Philosophical Investigations which had shattered the philosophical tradition of logical atomism in which he had richly participated I betook myself to my oYce at home in Santa Fe and grandly intoned through my fingers onto the computers disc Investigations on December I sensed my long search would uncover issues that were then only dimly visible to me I hoped the unfolding ongoing notebook would allow me to find the themes and link them into something that was vast and new but at the time inarticulateTwo years later in September of I published a modestly wellorganized version of Investigations as a Santa Fe Institute preprint launched it onto the web and put it aside for the time being I found I had indeed been led into arenas that I had in no way expected led by a swirl of ever new questions I put the notebooks aside but a year later I returned to the swirl taking up again a struggle to see something that I think is right in front of usalways the hardest thing to see This book is the fruit of these eVorts And this first chapter is but an introduction in brief to the themes that will be explained more fully in the following chapters I would ask the reader to be patient with unfamiliar terms and conceptsMy first eVorts had begun with twin questions First in addition to the known laws of thermodynamics could there possibly be a fourth law of thermodynamics for open thermodynamic systems some law that governs biospheres anywhere in the cosmos or the cosmos itself Second living entitiesbacteria plants and animalsmanipulate the world on their own behalf the bacterium swimming upstream in a glucose gradient that is easily said to be going to get dinner the paramecium cilia beating like a Roman warships oars hot after the bacterium we humans earning our livings Call the bacterium paramecium and us humans autonomous agents able to act on our own behalf in an environmentMy second and core question became What must a physical system be to be an autonomous agent Make no mistake we autonomous agents mutually construct our biosphere even as we coevolve in it Why and how this is so is a central subject of all that followsFrom the outset there were and remain reasons for deep skepticism about the enterprise of Investigations First there are very strong arguments to say that there can be no general law for open thermodynamic systems The core argument is simple to state Any computer program is an algorithm that given data produces some sequence of output finite or infinite Computer programs can always be written in the form of a binary symbol string of and symbols All possible binary symbol strings are possible computer programs Hence there is a countable or denumerable infinity of computer programs A theorem states that for most computer programs there is no compact description of the printout of the program Rather we must just unleash the program and watch it print what it prints In short there is no shorter description of the output of the program than that which can be obtained by running the program itself If by the concept of a law we mean a compact description ahead of time of what the computer program will print then for any such program there can be no law that allows us to predict what the program will actually do ahead of the actual running of the programThe next step is simple Any such program can be realized on a universal Turing machine such as the familiar computer But that computer is an open nonequilibrium thermodynamic system its openness visibly realized by the plug and power line that connects the computer to the electric power grid Therefore and I think this conclusion is cogent there can be no general law for all possible nonequilibrium thermodynamic systemsSo why was I conjuring the possibility of a general law for open thermodynamic systems Clearly no such general law can hold for all open thermodynamic systemsBut hold a moment It is we humans who conceived and built the intricate assembly of chips and logic gates that constitute a computer typically we humans who program it and we humans who contrived the entire power grid that supplies the electric power to run the computer itself This assemblage of latetwentiethcentury technology did not assemble itself We built itOn the other hand no one designed and built the biosphere The biosphere got itself constructed by the emergence and persistent coevolution of autonomous agents If there cannot be general laws for all open thermodynamic systems might there be general laws for thermodynamically open but selfconstructing systems such as biospheres I believe that the answer is yes Indeed among those candidate laws to be discussed in this book is a candidate fourth law of thermodynamics for such selfconstructing systemsTo roughly state the candidate law I suspect that biospheres maximize the average secular construction of the diversity of autonomous agents and the ways those agents can make a living to propagate further In other words on average biospheres persistently increase the diversity of what can happen next In eVect as we shall see later biospheres may maximize the average sustained growth of their own dimensionalityThus the enterprise of Investigations soon began to center on the character of the autonomous agents whose coevolution constructs a biosphere I was gradually led to a labyrinth of issues concerning the core features of autonomous agents able to manipulate the world on their own behalf It may be that those core features capture a proper definition of life and that definition diVers from the one Schrdinger foundTo state my hypothesis abruptly and without preamble I think an autonomous agent is a selfreproducing system able to perform at least one thermodynamic work cycle It will require most of this book to unfold the implications of this tentative definitionFollowing an eVort to understand what an autonomous agent might bewhich as just noted involves the concept of work cyclesI was led to the concepts of work itself constraints and work as the constrained release of energy In turn this led to the fact that work itself is often used to construct constraints on the release of energy that then constitutes further work So we confront a virtuous cycle Work constructs constraints yet constraints on the release of energy are required for work to be done Here is the heart of a new concept of organization that is not covered by our concepts of matter alone energy alone entropy alone or information alone In turn this led me to wonder about the relation between the emergence of constraints in the universe and in a biosphere and the diversification of patterns of the constrained release of energy that alone constitute work and the use of that work to build still further constraints on the release of energy How do biospheres construct themselves or how does the universe construct itselfThe considerations above led to the role of Maxwells demon one of the major places in physics where matter energy work and information come together The central point of the demon is that by making measurements on a system the information gained can be used to extract work I made a new distinction between measurements the demon might make that reveal features of nonequilibrium systems that can be used to extract work and measurements he might make of the nonequilibrium system that cannot be used to extract work How does the demon know what features to measure And in turn how does work actually come to be extracted by devices that measure and detect displacements from equilibrium from which work can in principle be obtained An example of such a device is a windmill pivoting to face the wind then extracting work by the wind turning its vanes Other examples are the rhodopsin molecule of a bacterium responding to a photon of light or a chloroplast using the constrained release of the energy of light to construct highenergy sugar molecules How do such devices come into existence in the unfolding universe and in our biosphere How does the vast web of constraint construction and constrained energy release used to construct yet more constraints happen into existence in the biosphere In the universe itself The answers appear not to be present in contemporary physics chemistry or biology But a coevolving biosphere accomplishes just this coconstruction of propagating organizationThus in due course I struggled with the concept of organization itself concluding that our concepts of entropy and its negative Shannons information theory which was developed initially to quantify telephonic traYc and had been greatly extended since then entirely miss the central issues What is happening in a biosphere is that autonomous agents are coconstructing and propagating organizations of work of constraint construction and of task completion that continue to propagate and proliferate diversifying organizationThis statement is just plain true Look out your window burrow down a foot or so and try to establish what all the microscopic life is busy doing and building and has done for billions of years let alone the macroscopic ecosystem of plants herbivores and carnivores that is slipping sliding hiding hunting bursting with flowers and leaves outside your window So I think we lack a concept of propagating organizationThen too there is the mystery of the emergence of novel functionalities in evolution where none existed before hearing sight flight language Whence this novelty I was led to doubt that we could prestate the novelty I came to doubt that we could finitely prestate all possible adaptations that might arise in a biosphere In turn I was led to doubt that we can prestate the configuration space of a biosphereBut how strange a conclusion In statistical mechanics with its famous liter box of gas as an isolated thermodynamic system we can prestate the configuration space of all possible positions and momenta of the gas particles in the box Then Ludwig Boltzmann and Willard Gibbs taught us how to calculate macroscopic properties such as pressure and temperature as equilibrium averages over the configuration space State the laws and the initial and boundary conditions then calculate Newton taught us how to do science this way What if we cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and calculate with Newtons method of fluxions the calculus from initial and boundary conditions and laws Whether we can calculate or not does not slow down the persistent evolution of novelty in the biosphere But a biosphere is just another physical system So what in the world is going on Literally what in the world is going onWe have much to investigate At the end I think we will know more than at the outset But Investigations is at best a mere beginningIt is well to return to Schrdingers brilliant insights and his attempt at a central definition of life as a wellgrounded starting place Schrdinger s What Is Life provided a surprising answer to his enquiry about the central character of life by posing a core question What is the source of the astonishing order in organisms The standardand Schrdinger argued incorrectanswer lay in statistical physics If an ink drop is placed in still water in a petri dish it will diVuse to a uniform equilibrium distribution That uniform distribution is an average over an enormous number of atoms or molecules and is not due to the behavior of individual molecules Any local fluctuations in ink concentration soon dissipate back to equilibriumCould statistical averaging be the source of order in organisms Schrdinger based his argument on the emerging field of experimental genetics and the recent data on Xray induction of heritable genetic mutations Calculating the target size of such mutations Schrdinger realized that a gene could comprise at most a few hundred or thousand atomsThe sizes of statistical fluctuations familiar from statistical physics scale as the square root of the number of particles N Consider tossing a fair coin times The result will be about percent heads percent tails with a fluctuation of about which is the square root of Thus a typical fluctuation from heads and tails is or percent Let the number of coin flips be million then the fluctuations are its square root or Dividing yields a typical deviation of percent from Schrdinger reached the correct conclusion If genes are constituted by as few as several hundred atoms the familiar statistical fluctuations predicted by statistical mechanics would be so large that heritability would be essentially impossible Spontaneous mutations would happen at a frequency vastly larger than observed The source of order must lie elsewhereQuantum mechanics argued Schrdinger comes to the rescue of life Quantum mechanics ensures that solids have rigidly ordered molecular structures A crystal is the simplest case But crystals are structurally dull The atoms are arranged in a regular lattice in three dimensions If you know the positions of all the atoms in a minimalunit crystal you know where all the other atoms are in the entire crystal This overstates the case for there can be complex defects but the point is clear Crystals have very regular structures so the diVerent parts of the crystal in some sense all say the same thing As shown below Schrdinger translated the idea of saying into the idea of encoding With that leap a regular crystal cannot encode much information All the information is contained in the unit cellIf solids have the order required but periodic solids such as crystals are too regular then Schrdinger puts his bet on aperiodic solids The stuV of the gene he bets is some form of aperiodic crystal The form of the aperiodicity will contain some kind of microscopic code that somehow controls the development of the organism The quantum character of the aperiodic solid will mean that small discrete changes or mutations will occur Natural selection operating on these small discrete changes will select out favorable mutations as Darwin hopedFifty years later I find Schrdingers argument fascinating and brilliant At once he envisioned what became by the elucidation of the structure of DNAs aperiodic double helix by James Watson and Francis Crick with the famously understated comment in their original paper that its structure suggests its mode of replication and its mode of encoding genetic informationFifty years later we know very much more We know the human genome harbors some to structural genes each encoding the RNA that after being transcribed from the DNA is translated according to the genetic code to a linear sequence of amino acids thereby constituting a protein From Schrdinger to the establishment of the code required only about twenty yearsBeyond the brilliance of the core of molecular genetics we understand much concerning developmental biology Humans have about diVerent cell types liver nerve muscle Each is a diVerent pattern of expression of the or genes Since the work of Franois Jacob and Jacques Monod thirtyfive years ago biologists have understood that the protein transcribed from one gene might turn other genes on or oV Some vast network of regulatory interactions among genes and their products provides the mechanism that marshals the genome into the dance of developmentWe have come close to Schrdingers dream But have we come close to answering his question What is life The answer almost surely is no I am unable to say all at once why I believe this but I can begin to hint at an explanation Investigations is a search for an answer I am not entirely convinced of what lies within this book the material is too new and far too surprising to warrant conviction Yet the pathways I have stumbled along glimpsing what may be a terra nova do seem to me to be worth serious presentation and serious considerationQuite to my astonishment the story that will unfold here suggests a novel answer to the question What is life I had not expected even the outlines of an answer and I am astonished because I have been led in such unexpected directions One direction suggests that an answer to this question may demand a fundamental alteration in how we have done science since Newton Life is doing something far richer than we may have dreamed literally something incalculable What is the place of law if as hinted above the variables and configuration space cannot be prespecified for a biosphere or perhaps a universe Yet I think there are laws And if these musings be true we must rethink science itselfPerhaps I can point again at the outset to the central question of an autonomous agent Consider a bacterium swimming upstream in a glucose gradient its flagellar motor rotating If we naively ask What is it doing we unhesitatingly answer something like Its going to get dinner That is without attributing consciousness or conscious purpose we view the bacterium as acting on its own behalf in an environment The bacterium is swimming upstream in order to obtain the glucose it needs Presumably we have in mind something like the Darwinian criteria to unpack the phrase on its own behalf Bacteria that do obtain glucose or its equivalent may survive with higher probability than those incapable of the flagellar motor trick hence be selected by natural selectionAn autonomous agent is a physical system such as a bacterium that can act on its own behalf in an environment All freeliving cells and organisms are clearly autonomous agents The quite familiar utterly astonishing feature of autonomous agentsE coli paramecia yeast cells algae sponges flat worms annelids all of usis that we do everyday manipulate the universe around us We swim scramble twist build hide snuZe pounceYet the bacterium the yeast cell and we all are just physical systems Physicists biologists and philosophers no longer look for a mysterious lan vital some ethereal vital force that animates matter Which leads immediately to the central and confusing question What must a physical system be such that it can act on its own behalf in an environment What must a physical system be such that it constitutes an autonomous agent I will leap ahead to state now my tentative answer A molecular autonomous agent is a selfreproducing molecular system able to carry out one or more thermodynamic work cyclesAll freeliving cells are by this definition autonomous agents To take a simple example our bacterium with its flagellar motor rotating and swimming upstream for dinner is in point of plain fact a selfreproducing molecular system that is carrying out one or more thermodynamic work cycles So is the paramecium chasing the bacterium hoping for its own dinner So is the dinoflagellate hunting the paramecium sneaking up on the bacterium So are the flower and flatworm So are you and IIt will take a while to fully explore this definition Unpacking its implications reveals much that I did not remotely anticipate An early insight is that an autonomous agent must be displaced from thermodynamic equilibrium Work cycles cannot occur at equilibrium Thus the concept of an agent is inherently a nonequilibrium concept So too at the outset it is clear that this new concept of an autonomous agent is not contained in Schrdingers answer Schrdingers brilliant leap to aperiodic solids encoding the organism that unleashed midtwentiethcentury biology appears to be but a glimmer of a far larger storyFootprints of Destiny The Birth of AstrobiologyThe telltale beginnings of that larger story are beginning to be formulated The US National Aeronautics and Space Agency has had a long program in exobiology the search for life elsewhere in the universe Among its wellknown interests are SETI a search for extraterrestrial life and the Mars probes Over the past three decades a sustained eVort has included a wealth of experiments aiming at discovering the abiotic origins of the organic molecules that are the building blocks of known living systemsIn the summer of NASA was busy attempting to formulate what it came to call astrobiology an attempt to understand the origin evolution and characteristics of life anywhere in the universe Astrobiology does not yet existit is a field in the birthing process Whatever the area comes to be called as it matures it seems likely to be a field of spectacular success and deep importance in the coming century A hint of the potential impact of astrobiology came in August with the tentative but excited reports of a Martian meteorite found in Antarctica that NASA scientists announced might have evidence of early Martian microbial life The White House organized the singleday Space Conference to which I was pleased to be invited Perhaps thirtyfive scientists and scholars gathered in the Old Executive OYce Building for a meeting led by Vice President Gore The vice president began the meeting with a rather unexpected question to the group If it should prove true that the Martian rock actually harbored fossilized microbial life what would be the least interesting result The room was silent for a moment Then Stephen Jay Gould gave the answer many of us must have been considering Martian life turns out to be essentially identical to Earth life same DNA RNA proteins code Were it so then we would all envision life flitting from planet to planet in our solar system It turns out that a minimum transit time for a fleck of Martian soil kicked into space to make it to earth is about fifteen thousand years Spores can survive that long under desiccating conditionsAnd what continued the vice president would be the most interesting result Ah said many of us in diVerent voices around the room Martian life is radically diVerent from Earth lifeIf radically diVerent thenIf radically diVerent then life must not be improbableIf radically diVerent then life may be abundant among the myriad stars and solar systems on far planets hinted at by our current astronomyIf radically diVerent and abundant then we are not aloneIf radically diVerent and abundant then we inhabit a universe rife with the creativity to create lifeIf radically diVerent thenthought I of my just published second bookwe are at home in the universeIf radically diVerent then we are on the threshold of a new biology a general biology freed from the confines of our known example of Earth lifeIf radically diVerent then a new science seeking the origins evolution characteristics and laws that may govern biospheres anywhereA general biology awaits us Call it astrobiology if you wish We confront the vast new task of understanding what properties and laws if any may characterize biospheres anywhere in the universe I find the prospect stunning I will argue that the concept of an autonomous agent will be central to the enterprise of a general biologyA personally delightful moment arose during that meeting The vice president it appeared had read At Home in the Universe or parts of it In At Home and also in this book I explore a theory I believe has deep merit one that asserts that in complex chemical reaction systems selfreproducing molecular systems form with high probabilityThe vice president looked across the table at me and asked Dr KauVman dont you have a theory that in complex chemical reaction systems life arises more or less spontaneouslyYesWell isnt that just sensibleI was of course rather thrilled but somewhat embarrassed The theory has been tested computationally but there are no molecular experiments to support it I answeredBut isnt it just sensible the vice president persistedI couldnt help my response Mr Vice President I have waited a long time for such confirmation With your permission sir I will use it to bludgeon my enemiesIm glad to say there was warm laughter around the table Would that scientific proof were so easily obtained Much remains to be done to test my theoryMany of us including Mr Gore while maintaining skepticism about the Mars rock itself spoke at that meeting about the spiritual impact of the discovery of life elsewhere in the universe The general consensus was that such a discovery linked to the sense of membership in a creative universe would alter how we see ourselves and our place under all all the suns I find it a gentle thrilling quiet and transforming visionMolecular DiversityWe are surprisingly well poised to begin an investigation of a general biology for such a study will surely involve the understanding of the collective behaviors of very complex chemical reaction networks After all all known life on earth is based on the complex webs of chemical reactionsDNA RNA proteins metabolism linked cycles of construction and destructionthat form the life cycles of cells In the past decade we have crossed a threshold that will rival the computer revolution We have learned to construct enormously diverse libraries of diVerent DNA RNA proteins and other organic molecules Armed with such highdiversity libraries we are in a position to begin to study the properties of complex chemical reaction networksTo begin to understand the molecular diversity revolution consider a crude estimate of the total organic molecular diversity of the biosphere There are perhaps a hundred million species Humans have about a hundred thousand structural genes encoding that many diVerent proteins If all the genes within a species were identical and all the genes in diVerent species were at least slightly diVerent the biosphere would harbor about ten trillion diVerent proteins Within a few orders of magnitude ten trillion will serve as an estimate of the organic molecular diversity of the natural biosphere But the current technology of molecular diversity that generates libraries of more or less random DNA RNA or proteins now routinely produces a diversity of a hundred trillion molecular species in a single test tubeIn our hubris we rival the biosphereThe field of molecular diversity was born to help solve the problem of drug discovery The core concept is simple Consider a human hormone such as estrogen Estrogen acts by binding to a specific receptor protein think of the estrogen as a key and the receptor as a lock Now generate sixtyfour million diVerent small proteins called peptides say six amino acids in length Since there are twenty types of amino acids the number of possible hexamers is hence sixtyfour million The sixtyfour million hexamer peptides are candidate second keys any one of which might be able to fit into the same estrogen receptor lock into which estrogen fits If so any such second key may be similar to the first key estrogen and hence is a candidate drug to mimic or modulate estrogenTo find such an estrogen mimic take many identical copies of the estrogen receptor afix them to the bottom of a petri plate and expose them simultaneously to all sixtyfour million hexamers Wash oV all the peptides that do not stick to the estrogen receptor then recover those hexamers that do stick to the estrogen receptor Any such peptide is a second key that binds the estrogen receptor locks and hence is a candidate estrogen mimicThe procedure works and works brilliantly By George Smith at the University of Missouri used a specific kind of virus a filamentous phage that infects bacteria The phage is a strand of RNA that encodes proteins Among these proteins is the coat protein that packages the head of the phage as part of an infective phage particle George cloned random DNA sequences encoding random hexamer peptides into one end of the phage coat protein gene Each phage then carried a diVerent random DNA sequence in its coat protein gene hence made a coat protein with a random six amino acid sequence at one end The initial resulting phage display libraries had about twenty million of the sixtyfour million diVerent possible hexamer peptidesRather than using the estrogen receptor and seeking a peptide estrogen mimic that binds the estrogen receptor George Smith used a monoclonal antibody molecule as the analogue of the receptor and sought a hexamer peptide that could bind the monoclonal antibody Monoclonal antibody technology allows the generation of a large number of identical antibody molecules hence George could use these as identical mock receptors George found that among the twenty million diVerent phage about one in a million would stick to his specific monoclonal antibody molecules In fact George found nineteen diVerent hexamers binding to his monoclonal antibody Moreover the nineteen diVerent hexamers diVered from one another on average in three of the six amino acid positions All had high aYnity for his monoclonal antibody target These results have been of very deep importance Phage display is now a central part of drug discovery in many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies The discovery of drug leads is being transformed from a diYcult to a routine task Not only is work being pursued using peptides but also using RNA and DNA sequences Molecular diversity has now spread to the generation of highdiversity libraries of small organic molecules an approach called combinatorial chemistry The promise is of high medical importance As we understand better the genetic diversity of the human population we can hope to create wellcrafted molecules with increased eYcacy as drugs vaccines enzymes and novel molecular structures When the capacity to craft such molecules is married as it will be in the coming decades to increased understanding of the genetic and cellular signaling pathways by which ontogeny is controlled we will enter an era of postgenomic medicine By learning to control gene regulation and cell signaling we will begin to control cell proliferation cell diVerentiation and tissue regeneration to treat pathologies such as cancer autoimmune diseases and degenerative diseasesBut George Smiths experiments are also of immediate interest and in surprising ways that will bear on our later discussion of autonomous agentsGeorges experiments have begun to verify the concept of a shape space put forth by George Oster and Alan Perelson of the University of California Berkeley and Los Alamos National Laboratory more than a decade earlier In turn shape space suggests catalytic task space We will need both to understand autonomous agentsOster and Perelson had been concerned about accounting for the fact that humans can make about a hundred million diVerent antibody molecules Why they wondered They conceived of an abstract shape space with perhaps seven or eight dimensions Three of these dimensions would correspond to the three spatial dimensions length height and width of a molecular binding site Other dimensions might correspond to physical properties of the binding sites of molecules such as charge dipole moment and hydrophobicityA point in shape space would represent a molecular shape An antibody binds its shape complement key and lock But the precision with which an antibody can recognize its shape complement is finite Some jiggle room is allowed So an antibody molecule covers a kind of ball of complementary shapes in shape space And then comes the sweet argument If an antibody covers a ball an actual volume in shape space then a finite number of balls will suYce to cover all of shape space A reasonable analogy is that a finite number of PingPong balls will fill up a bedroomBut how big of a PingPong ball in shape space is covered by one antibody Oster and Perelson reasoned that in order for an immune system to protect an organism against disease its antibody repertoire should cover a reasonable fraction of shape space Newts with about ten thousand diVerent antibody molecules have the minimal known antibody diversity Perelson and Oster guessed that the newt repertoire must cover a substantial fraction say about ewhere e is the natural base for logarithmsor percent of shape space Dividing percent by gives the fractional volume of shape space covered by one antibody molecule It follows that such balls thrown at random into shape space and allowed to overlap one another will saturate shape space So million antibody molecules is all we need to recognize virtually any shape of the size scale of molecular binding sitesAnd therefore the concept of shape space carries surprising implications Not surprisingly similar molecules can have similar shapes More surprisingly very diVerent molecules can have the same shape Examples include endorphin and morphine Endorphin is a peptide hormone When endorphin binds the endorphin brain receptor a euphoric state is induced Morphine a completely diVerent kind of organic molecule binds the endorphin receptor as well with wellknown consequences Still more surprising a finite number of diVerent molecules about a hundred million can constitute a universal shape library Thus while there are vastly many diVerent proteins the number of eVectively diVerent shapes may only be on the order of a hundred millionIf one molecule binding to a second molecule can be thought of as carrying out a binding task then about a hundred million diVerent molecules may constitute a universal toolbox for all molecular binding tasks So if we can now create libraries with trillion diVerent proteins a millionfold in excess of the universal library we are in a position to begin to study molecular binding in earnestBut there may also be a universal enzymatic toolbox Enzymes catalyze or speed up chemical reactions Consider a substrate molecule undergoing a reaction to a product molecule Physical chemists think of the substrate and product molecules as lying in two potential energy wells like a ball at the bottom of one of two adjacent bowls A chemical reaction requires lifting the substrate energetically to the top of the barrier between the bowls Physically the substrates bonds are maximally strained and deformed at the top of this potential barrier The deformed molecule is called the transition state According to transition state theory an enzyme works by binding to and stabilizing the transition state molecule thereby lowering the potential barrier of the reaction Since the probability that a molecule acquires enough energy to hop to the top of the potential barrier is exponentially less as the barrier height increases the stabilization of the transition state by the enzyme can speed up the reaction by many orders of magnitudeThink of a catalytic task space in which a point represents a catalytic task where a catalytic task is the binding of a transition state of a reaction Just as similar molecules can have similar shapes so too can similar reactions have similar transition states hence such reactions constitute similar catalytic tasks Just as diVerent molecules can have the same shape so too can diVerent reactions have similar transition states hence constitute the same catalytic task Just as an antibody can bind to and cover a ball of similar shapes an enzyme can bind to and cover a ball of similar catalytic tasks Just as a finite number of balls can cover shape space a finite number of balls can cover catalytic task spaceIn short a universal enzymatic toolbox is possible Clues that such a toolbox is experimentally feasible come from many recent developments including the discovery that antibody molecules evolved to bind molecular features called epitopes can actually act as catalystsCatalytic antibodies are obtained exactly as one might expect given the concept of a catalytic task space One would like an antibody molecule that binds the transition state of a reaction But transition states are ephemeral Since they last only fractions of a second one cannot immunize with a transition state itself Instead one immunizes with a stable analogue of the transition shape that is one immunizes with a second molecule that represents the same catalytic task as does the transition state itself Antibody molecules binding to this transition state analogue are tested Typically about one in ten antibody molecules can function as at least a weak catalyst for the corresponding reactionThese results even allow a crude estimate of the probability that a randomly chosen antibody molecule will catalyze a randomly chosen reaction About one antibody in a hundred thousand can bind a randomly chosen epitope About one in ten antibodies that bind the transition state analogue act as catalysts By this crude calculation about one in a million antibody molecules can catalyze a given reactionThis rough calculation is probably too high by several orders of magnitude even for antibody molecules Recent experiments begin to address the probability that a randomly chosen peptide or DNA or RNA sequence will catalyze a randomly chosen reaction The answer for DNA or RNA appears to be about one in a billion to one in a trillion If we now make libraries of a hundred trillion random DNA RNA and protein molecules we may already have in hand universal enzymatic toolboxes Virtually any reaction on the proper molecular scale of reasonable substrates and products probably has one or more catalysts in such a universal toolboxIn short among the radical implications of molecular diversity is that we already possess hundreds of millions of diVerent molecular functionsbinding catalytic structural and otherwiseIn our hubris we rival the biosphereIn our humility we can begin to formulate a general biology and begin to investigate the collective behaviors of hugely diverse molecular libraries Among these collective behaviors must be life itselfLife as an Emergent Collective Behavior of Complex Chemical NetworksIn the summer of Philip Anderson a Nobel laureate in physics and I accompanied Dr Henry MacDonald incoming director of NASA Ames to NASA headquarters Our purpose was to discuss a new linked experimental and theoretical approach to the originoflife problem with NASA Administrator Dan Golden and his colleague Dr Wesley Huntress I was excited and delightedAs long ago as I had published my own first foray into the originoflife problem as a young assistant professor in the Department of Theoretical Biology at the University of Chicago I had wondered if life must be based on template replicating nucleic acids such as DNA or RNA double helices and found myself doubting that standard assumption Life at its core depends upon autocatalysis that is reproduction Most catalysis in cells is carried out by protein enzymes Might there be general laws supporting the possibility that systems of catalytic polymers such as proteins might be selfreproducing Proteins are as noted linear sequences of twenty kinds of standard amino acids Consider then a first copy of a protein that has the capacity to catalyze a reaction by which two fragments of a potential second copy of that same protein might be ligated to make the second copy of the whole protein Such a protein A say thirtytwo amino acids long might act on two fragments say fifteen amino acids and seventeen amino acids in length and ligate the two to make a second copy of the thirtytwo amino acid sequenceBut if one could imagine a molecule A catalyzing its own formation from its own fragments could one not imagine two proteins A and B having the property that A catalyzes the formation of B by ligating Bs fragments into a second copy of B while B catalyzes the formation of A by catalyzing the ligation of As fragments into a second copy of A Such a little reaction system would be collectively autocatalytic Neither A alone nor B alone would catalyze its own formation Rather the AB system would jointly catalyze its reproduction from A and B fragments But if A and B might achieve collective autocatalysis might one envision a system with tens or hundreds of proteins or peptides that were collectively autocatalyticMight collective autocatalysis of proteins or similar polymers be the basic source of selfreproduction in molecular systems Or must life be based on template replication as envisioned by Watson and Crick or as envisioned even earlier by Schrdinger in his aperiodic solid with its microcode In view of the potential for a general biology what in fact are the alternative bases for selfreproducing molecular systems here and anywhere in the cosmos Which of these alternatives is more probable here and anywhereBy I had asked and found a preliminary answer to the following question In a complex mixture of diVerent proteins where the proteins might be able to serve as candidates to ligate one another into still larger amino acid sequences what are the chances that such a system will contain one or more collectively autocatalytic sets of molecules In the next chapter I will discuss the current state of theory and experiment on this issue The best current guess is that as the molecular diversity of a reaction system increases a critical threshold is reached at which collectively autocatalytic selfreproducing chemical reaction networks emerge spontaneouslyIf this view is correct and the kinetic conditions for rapid reactions can be sustained perhaps by enclosure of such a reproducing system in a bounding membrane vesicle also synthesized by the system the emergence of selfreproducing molecular systems may be highly probable No small conclusion this Life abundant emergent expected Life spattered across megaparsecs galaxies galactic clusters We as members of a creative mysteriously unfolding universe Moreover the hypothesis is richly testable and as described in the next chapter is now under the early stages of testingOne way or another we will discover a second lifecrouched under a Mars rock frozen in time limpid in some pool on Titan in some test tube in Nebraska in the next few decades We will discover a second life one way or anotherWhat monumental transformations await us proudly postmodern mingled with peoples on this very globe still wedded to archetypes thousands of years oldThe Strange Thing About the Theory of EvolutionWe do not understand evolution We live it with moss fruit fin and quill fellows We see it since Darwin We have insights of forms and their formation won from eVorts since Aristotle codified the embryological investigations that over twentyfive centuries ago began with the study of deformed fetuses in sacrificial animalsBut we do not understand evolutionThe strange thing about the theory of evolution said one of the Huxleys although I cannot find which one is that everyone thinks he understands it How very well stated in that British fashion Americans can admire but not emulate Two peoples separated by a common language as Churchill dryly put itThe strange thing about the theory of evolution is that everyone thinks he understands it How very true It seems of course so simple Finches hop around the Galapagos occasionally migrating from island to island Small and large beaks serve for diVerent seeds Beaks fitting seeds feed the young Wellwrought beaks are selected Mutations are the feedstock of heritable variation in a population Populations evolve by mutation mating recombination and selection to give the wellmarked varieties that are for Darwin new species Phylogenies bushy in the biosphere Were here were here cry all for their typical fourmillionyearstay along the fourbillionyear pageantWere hereBut howHow in many senses First Darwins theory of evolution is a theory of descent with modification It does not yet explain the genesis of forms but the trimmings of the forms once they are generated Rather like achieving an apple tree by trimming oV all the branches said a latenineteenthcentury skepticHow in the most fundamental sense Whence life in the first place Darwin starts with life already here Whence life is the stuV of all later questions about whence the forms to siftHow in still a diVerent sense Darwin assumed gradualism Most variation would be minor Selection would sift these insensible alterations a bit more lift a little less drag until the wing flew faultless in the highhoped sky a falcons knotwinged clawlatching dive to dineBut whence the gradualism itself It is not God given but true that organisms are hardly aVected by most mutations Most mutations do have little eVect some have major eVects In Drosophila many mutants make small modifications in bristle number color shape A few change wings to legs eyes to antennae heads to genitalia Suppose that all mutations were of dramatic eVect Suppose to take the limiting philosophical case that all mutations were what geneticists call lethals Since indeed some mutations are lethals one can a priori imagine creatures in which all mutations were lethal prior to having oVspring Might be fine creatures too in the absence of any mutations these evolutionary descendants of well of what And progenitors of whom No pathway to or from these luckless onesThus evolution must somehow be crafting the very capacity of creatures to evolve Evolution nurtures herself But not yet in Darwins theory nor yet in oursTake another casesex Yes it captures our attention and the attention of most members of most species Most species are sexual But why bother Asexuals budding quietly wherever they bud require only a single parent We plumaged ones require two a twofold loss in fitnessWhy sex The typical answer to which I adhere is that sexual mating gives the opportunity for genetic recombination In genetic recombination the double chromosome complement sets maternal and paternal homologues pair up break and recombine to yield oVspring chromosomes the left half of which derives from one parental chromosome the right half of which derives from the other parental chromosomeRecombination is said to be a useful search procedure in an evolving population Consider a geneticist would say two genes each with two versions or alleles A and a for the first gene B and b for the second gene Suppose A confers a selective advantage compared to a and B confers an advantage with respect to b In the absence of sex mating and recombination a rabbit with A and b would have to wait for a mutation to convert b to B That might take a long time But with mating and recombination a rabbit with A on the left end of a maternal chromosome and B on the right end of the homologous paternal chromosome might experience recombination A and B would now be on a single chromosome hence be passed on to the oVspring Recombination therefore can be a lot faster than waiting for mutation to assemble the good AB chromosomeBut it is not so obvious that recombination is a good idea after all At the molecular level the recombination procedure is rather like taking an airplane and a motorcycle breaking both in half and using spare bolts to attach the back half of the airplane to the front half of the motorcycle The resulting contraption seems useless for any purpose In short the very usefulness of recombination depends upon the gradualness that Darwin assumed In later chapters I will discuss the concept of a fitness landscape The basic idea is simple Consider a set of all possible frogs each with a diVerent genotype Locate each frog in a highdimensional genotype space each next to all genotypes that diVer from it by a single mutation Imagine that you can measure the fitness of each frog Graph the fitness of each frog as a height above that position in genotype space The resulting heights form a fitness landscape over the genotype space much as the Alps form a mountainous landscape over part of EuropeIn the fitness landscape image mutation recombination and selection can conspire to pull evolving populations upward toward the peaks of high fitness But not always It is relatively easy to show that recombination is only a useful search procedure on smooth fitness landscapes The smoothness of a fitness landscape can be defined mathematically by a correlation function giving the similarity of fitnesses or heights at two points on the landscape separated by a mutational distance In the Alps most nearby points are of similar heights except for cliVs but points fifty kilometers apart can be of very diVerent heights Fifty kilometers is beyond the correlation length of the AlpsThere is good evidence that recombination is only a useful search strategy on smooth highly correlated landscapes where the high peaks all cluster near one another Recombination half airplanehalf motorcycle is a means to look between two positions in a highdimensional space Then if both points are in the region of high peaks looking between those two points is likely to uncover further new points of high fitness or points on the slopes of even higher peaks Thereafter further mutation recombination and selection can bring the adapting population to successively higher peaks in the highpeaked region of the genotype space If landscapes are very rugged and the high peaks do not cluster into smallish regions recombination turns out to be a useless search strategyBut most organisms are sexual If organisms are sexual because recombination is a good search strategy but recombination is only useful as a search strategy on certain classes of fitness landscapes where did those fitness landscapes come from No one knowsThe strange thing about evolution is that everyone thinks he understands itSomehow evolution has brought forth the kind of smooth landscapes upon which recombination itself is a successful search strategyMore generally two young scientists then at the Santa Fe Institute proved a rather unsettling theorem Bill Macready and David Wolpert called it the nofreelunch theorem They asked an innocent question Are there some search procedures that are good search procedures no matter what the problem is To formalize this Bill and David considered a mathematical conveniencea set of all possible fitness landscapes To be simple and concrete consider a large threedimensional room Divide the room into very small cubic volumes perhaps a millimeter on a side Let the number of these small volumes in the room be large say a trillion Now consider all possible ways of assigning integers between one and a trillion to these small volumes Any such assignment can be thought of as a fitness landscape with the integer representing the fitness of that position in the roomNext formalize a search procedure as a process that somehow samples M distinct volumes among the trillion in the room A search procedure specifies how to take the M samples An example is a random search choosing the M boxes at random A second procedure starts at a box and samples its neighbors climbing uphill via neighboring boxes toward higher integers Still another procedure picks a box samples neighbors and picks those with lower integers then continuesThe nofreelunch theorem says that averaged over all possible fitness landscape no search procedure outperforms any other search procedure What Averaged over all possible fitness landscapes you would do as well trying to find a large integer by searching randomly from an initial box for your M samples as you would climbing sensibly uphill from your initial boxThe theorem is correct In the absence of any knowledge or constraint on the fitness landscape on average any search procedure is as good as any otherBut life uses mutation recombination and selection These search procedures seem to be working quite well Your typical bat or butterfly has managed to get itself evolved and seems a rather impressive entity The nofreelunch theorem brings into high relief the puzzle If mutation recombination and selection only work well on certain kinds of fitness landscapes yet most organisms are sexual and hence use recombination and all organisms use mutation as a search mechanism where did these wellwrought fitness landscapes come from such that evolution manages to produce the fancy stuV around usHere I think is how Think of an organisms niche as a way of making a living Call a way of making a living a natural game Then of course natural games evolve with the organisms making those livings during the past four billion years What then are the winning games Naturally the winning games are the games the winning organisms play One can almost see Darwin nod But what games are those What games are the games the winners playWays of making a living natural games that are well searched out and well mastered by the evolutionary search strategies of organisms namely mutation and recombination will be precisely the niches or ways of making a living that a diversifying and speciating population of organisms will manage to master The ways of making a living presenting fitness landscapes that can be well searched by the procedures that organisms have in hand will be the very ways of making a living that readily come into existence If there were a way of making a living that could not be well explored and exploited by organisms as they speciate that way of making a living would not become populated Good jobs like successful jobholders prosperSo organisms niches and search procedures jointly and selfconsistently coconstruct one another We make the world in which we make a living such that we can and have more or less mastered that evolving world as we make it The same is true I will argue for an econosphere A web of economic activities firms tasks jobs workers skills and learning selfconsistently came into existence in the last forty thousand years of human evolutionThe strange thing about the theory of evolution is that everyone thinks he understands it But we do not A biosphere or an econosphere selfconsistently coconstructs itself according to principles we do not yet fathomLaws for a BiosphereBut there must be principles Think of the Magna Carta that cultural enterprise founded on a green meadow in England when John I was confronted by his nobles British common law has evolved by precedent and determinations to a tangled web of moreorless wisdom When a judge makes a new determination sets a new precedent ripples of new interpretation pass to near and occasionally far reaches of the law Were it the case that every new precedent altered the interpretation of all old judgments the common law could not have coevolved into its rich tapestry Conversely if new precedents never sent out ripples the common law could hardly evolve at allThere must be principles of coevolutionary assembly for biospheres economic systems legal systems Coevolutionary assembly must involve coevolving organizations flexible enough to change but firm enough to resist change Edmund Burke was basically right Might there be something deep here Some hint of a law of coevolutionary assemblyPerhaps I begin with the simple example oVered by Per Bak and his colleagues some years agoBaks sand pile and selforganized criticality The experiment requires a table and some sand Drop the sand slowly on the table The sand gradually piles up fills the tabletop piles to the rest angle of sand then sand avalanches begin to fall to the floorKeep adding sand slowly to the sand pile and plot the size distribution of sand avalanches You will obtain many small avalanches and progressively fewer large avalanches In fact you will achieve a characteristic size distribution called a power law Power law distributions are easily seen if one plots the logarithm of the number of avalanches at a given size on the yaxis and the logarithm of the size of the avalanche on the xaxis In the sand pile case a straight line sloping downward to the right is obtained The slope is the power law relation between the size and number of avalanchesBak and his friends called their sand pile selforganized critical Here critical means that avalanches occur on all length scales selforganized means that the system tunes itself to this critical stateMany of us have now explored the application of Baks ideas in models of coevolution that I will discuss shortly With caveats that other explanations may account for the data the general result is that something may occur that is like a theory of coevolutionary assembly that yields a selforganized critical biosphere with a power law distribution of small and large avalanches of extinction and speciation events As we shall see the best data now suggest that precisely such a power law distribution of extinction and speciation events has occurred over the past million years of the Phanerozoic In addition the same body of theory predicts that most species go extinct soon after their formation while some live a long time The predicted species lifetime distribution is a power law So too are the data Similar phenomena may occur in an econosphere Small and large avalanches of extinction and speciation events occur in our technologies A colleague Brian Arthur is fond of pointing out that when the car came in the horse buggy buggy whip saddlery smithy and Pony Express went out of business The car paved the way for an oil and gas industry paved roads motels fastfood restaurants and suburbia The Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter wrote about this kind of turbulence in capitalist economies These Schumpeterian gales of creative destruction appear to occur in small and large avalanches Perhaps the avalanches arise in power laws And like species most firms die young some make it to old ageStorre in Sweden is over nine hundred years old The distribution of firm lifetimes is again a power lawHere are hintscommon law ecosystems economic systemsthat general principles govern the coevolutionary coconstruction of lives and livings organisms and natural games firms and economic opportunities Perhaps such a law governs any biosphere anywhere in the cosmosI shall suggest other candidate laws for any biosphere in the course of Investigations As autonomous agents coconstruct a biosphere each must manage to categorize and act upon its world in its own behalf What principles might govern that categorization and action one might begin to wonder I suspect that autonomous agents coevolve such that each makes the maximum diversity of reliable discriminations upon which it can act reliably as it swims scrambles pokes twists and pounces This simple view leads to a working hypothesis Communities of agents will coevolve to an edge of chaos between overrigid and overfluid behavior The working hypothesis is richly testable today using for example microbial communitiesMoreover autonomous agents forever push their way into noveltymolecular morphological behavioral organizational I will formalize this push into novelty as the mathematical concept of an adjacent possible persistently explored in a universe that can never in the vastly many lifetimes of the universe have made all possible protein sequences even once bacterial species even once or legal systems even once Our universe is vastly nonrepeating or as the physicists say the universe is vastly nonergodic Perhaps there are laws that govern this nonergodic flow I will suggest that a biosphere gates its way into the adjacent possible at just that rate at which its inhabitants can just manage to make a living just poised so that selection sifts out useless variations slightly faster than those variations arise We ourselves in our biosphere econosphere and technosphere gate our rate of discovery There may be hints here too of a general law for any biosphere a hopedfor new law for selfconstructing systems of autonomous agents Biospheres on average may enter their adjacent possible as rapidly as they can sustain so too may econospheres Then the hopedfor fourth law of thermodynamics for such selfconstructing systems will be that they tend to maximize their dimensionality the number of types of events that can happen nextAnd astonishingly we need stories If as I will suggest we cannot prestate the configuration space variables laws initial and boundary conditions of a biosphere if we cannot foretell a biosphere we can nevertheless tell the stories as it unfolds Biospheres demand their Shakespeares as well as their Newtons We will have to rethink what science is itself And C P Snows two cultures the humanities and science may find an unexpected inevitable unionInvestigations leads us to new views of the biosphere as a coconstructing system In the final chapter I step beyond the central concern with autonomous agents to consider the universe itself Again there are hints of coconstructionof the laws themselves of the complexity of the universe of geometry itself The epilogue concludes with limits to reductionism in its strong form and an invocation to a constructivist science Chapter A Coconstructing Cosmosrom biospheres to the cosmos Yes because they may share general themes The major enquiry of Investigations has concerned autonomous agents and their coconstruction of biospheres and econospheres whose configuration spaces cannot be finitely prestated These themes find echoes in thinking about the cosmos as a whole But abundant caution I am not a physicist the problems are profound and we risk nonsenseWhatever the risk two facts are true First since the big bang our universe has become enormously complex Second we do not have a theory for why the universe is complex Equally unarguably the biosphere has increased in molecular diversity over the past four billion years just as the standing diversity of species has increased And equally unarguably the econosphere has become more complex over the past few million years of hominid evolution We know this with confidence If we lack a theory it is not because the staggering facts of increasing diversity and complexity that stare us in the face do not deserve a theory to account for themBut we have seen hints of such a theory in the coconstruction of biospheres and econospheres by the selfconsistent search of autonomous agents for ways to make a living the resulting exapting novel ways of making livings the fact that new adjacent niches for yet further new species grow in diversity faster than the species whose generation creates those new adjacent possible niches and the search mechanisms to master those modes of being We have seen a glimmer of something like a fourth law a tendency for selfconstructing biospheres to enlarge their workspace the dimensionality of their adjacent possible perhaps as fast on average as is possibleglimmers only not yet wellfounded theory nor wellestablished fact But glimmers often precede later scienceConsider again how the chemical diversity of the biosphere has become more diverse in the past four billion years urged into its adjacent possible by the genuine chemical potential from the chemical actual into the adjacent possible where the actual substrates exist and the adjacent possible products do not yet exist Each time the molecular diversity of the biosphere expands the set of adjacent possible reactions expands even faster Recall our simple calculation that for modestly complex organic molecules any pair of molecules could undergo at least one two substratetwo product reaction But then the diversity of possible reactions is the square of the diversity of chemicals in the system As the diversity of molecular species increases there are always proportionally more novel reactions into the adjacent possible If we take the formation of a chemical species that has never existed in the biosphere or perhaps the universe as a breaking symmetry then the more such symmetries are broken the more ways come into existence by which yet further symmetries may be brokenAnd the chemical case makes clear the linking of the flows of matter and energy in this sprawling chemical diversity explosion Many such reactions will link exergonic and endergonic processes As this occurs energy is pumped from the exergonic partner into the products requiring endergonic synthesis These productsthe chemical diversity in the bark of a redwood tree for exampletake their place in the chemical actual poising the biosphere and thus the universe for its next plunge into the chemical adjacent possibleConsider again equilibrium statistical mechanics At its core statistical mechanics relies on the same kind of statistical argument as does the flipping of a fair coin times We all understand that distributions of roughly heads and tails are far more probable macrostates than distributions with all heads or all tails Now consider the general argument I have made that as molecular diversity increases the diversity of reactions increases even faster and that there is a genuine chemical potential from the actual into the adjacent possible And consider again the general argument made just above that the greater the diversity of molecular species and reactions the more likely the coupling of exergonic and endergonic reaction pairs driving the endergonic synthesis of new adjacent possible molecules that poise the system to advance again into the next adjacent possible While the detailed statistical form of these chemical reaction graphs are not yet known they too smell of law As in the case of fair coin flips and equilibrium statistical mechanics it is as if here again the mathematical structure compels the consequent behavior of matter and energy In the case of the nonergodic and nonequilibrium chemical flux into the adjacent possible the universe is busy diversifying itself into myriad complexityThe universe is enormously complex and we dont really yet know why May there be new ways of thinking of the cosmos itself If a mere glimmer can be acceptable as potentially useful early science then the burden of this chapter is to suggest perhaps yesIt is not obvious in fact that the universe should be complex One can imagine universes governed by general relativity that burst briefly into big bang being then recollapse in a rapid big crunch within parts of a second or a century Alternatively one can imagine universes governed by general relativity that burst into big bang being and expanded forever with no further complexity than hydrogen and helium and smaller particles in an open and everexpanding dark cold vastnessHere we are poised it seems but see below between a universe that will expand forever and a universe that will eventually ease into gentle contraction then rush to a big crunchOur fundamental theories in physics and just one level up biology remain ununited Einsteins austere general relativity our theory of space time and geometry on the macroscale floats untethered to quantum mechanics our theory of the microscale seventyfive years after quantum mechanics emerged in Schrdingers equation form for wave mechanics Theoretically apart general relativity and quantum mechanics are both verified to eleven decimal places by appropriate tests But it remains true that general relativity and quantum mechanics remain fitfully fit fitfully ununited And Darwins view of persistent coevolution remains by and large unconnected with our fundamental physics even though the evolution of the biosphere is manifestly a physical process in the universe Physicists cannot escape this problem by saying Oh thats biologyThe Complexity of the UniverseWhy the universe is complex rather than simple is in fact beginning to emerge as a legitimate and deep question In the past several years I have had the pleasure to come to know Lee Smolin whose career is devoted to quantum gravity and cosmology Most of what I shall write in this chapter reflects my conversations and work with Lee and his colleagues who have been wonderfully welcoming to this biologist Sometimes outsiders can make serious contributions Sometimes outsiders just make damned fools of themselvesCaveat lector but I will continueIn Smolins book The Life of the Cosmos he raises directly the question of why the universe is complex Current particle physics has united three of the four fundamental forcesthe electromagnetic weak and strong forces called the standard model With general relativity which deals with the remaining force gravity this provides a consistent framework Particle physics plus general relativity have altogether some twenty constants of nature which are parameters of the standard model and general relativity such as the value of Plancks constant h the fine structure constant that is the ratio of the electron rest mass to proton rest mass the gravitational constant g and so forth Smolin puts approximate maximum and minimum bounds on these twenty constants and asks a straightforward question In a twentydimensional parameter space ranging over the plausible values of these twenty constants what volume of that parameter space is consistent with values of the constants that would yield a complex universe with stars chemistry and potentially lifeSmolins rough answer is that the volume of parameter space for the constants of nature that would yield a complex universe are something like raised to the minus th power That is a tiny fraction of the possible combinations of the values of the constants are consistent with the existence of chemistry and stars as well as life For the universe to be complex the constants must be sharply tunedSmolins argument could be o by many orders of magnitude without destroying his central point The fact that our universe is complex based on our current theories of the standard model and general relativity is surprising even astonishingly surprisingMany physicists have remarked upon this fine tuning of the constantsThere have been several responses to this issue some raised prior to Smolins work One is based on a view of multiple universes and the weak anthropic principle This principle states that there exist multiple universes but only those universes that were complex would sport life forms with the wit to wonder why their universe was complex So the very fact that we humans are here to wonder about this issue merely means that we happen to be in one of the complex universes among vastly many universes The argument is at least coherent But its hard to be thrilled by this answerThe strong anthropic principle goes furtherindeed too farand posits that for mysterious reasons the universe is contrived such that life must arise to observe it and wonder at it Few think the strong anthropic principle counts as science in any guiseSmolin points out that there are two possible answers to the puzzle of the complexity of the universe Either we will find a parameterfree descriptiona kind of supertheorythat yields something like our complex universe with its constants or some historical process must pick those constants Smolin proposes the possibility of cosmic natural selection Here daughter universes are born of black holes Universes with more black holes will have more daughter universes Given minor heritable variation in the constants of the laws of the daughter universes cosmic natural selection will select for universes whose constants support the formation of a nearmaximum number of black holes He then argues that on very crude calculations most alterations in the known constants would be expected to lower the number of black holes Lee points out that his theory is testable for example by deducing that our constants correspond to nearmaximum black hole production and that his theory has not been ruled out yetI confess I am fond of and admire Lee Smolin a great deal but I dont like his hypothesis Why Well preferably one would like a theory that had the consequence that any universe would be complex like ours and roughly poised between expansion and contraction We have no such theory at present of course The remainder of this chapter discusses ideas and a research program that just might point in this directionAs a start we can begin with the most current view of the largescale structure and dynamics of the universe The most recent evidence suggests that on a large enough scale the universe is flat the matter distribution is isotropic anda recent surprisethe universe may be expanding at an accelerating rate This latest result if it holds true contravenes the accepted view of the past several decades that the rate of expansion of the universe has been gradually slowing since the big bang The hypothesis that the universe is exactly poised between persistent expansion and eventual collapse has held that the rate of expansion of the universe will gradually slow but never stopOne way to explain a persistent accelerating expansion of a flat universe is to reintroduce Einsteins cosmological constant into the field equations of general relativity A positive cosmological constant expresses itself as a repulsive force between masses that increases with the distance between those masses Some physicists think that a positive cosmological constant must be associated with some new source of energy in free space The source of such an energy is currently unknownQuantum Mechanics and ClassicityBefore turning to the huge diculties of quantum gravity we should review the fundamental mystery of quantum mechanics Most readers are familiar with the famous twoslit experiment which exhibits the fundamental oddness of quantum interference Feynman in his famous threevolume lectures on physics gives the mystery as simply as possible We begin with a gun shooting bullets The bullets pass through one of two holes in a metal plate and fly further on landing on a flat layer of sand in a box Bullets passing through either hole may be deflected slightly by hitting the walls of the hole Thus in the sandbox behind the metal plate we would expect and actually would find two mounds of bullets Each mound would be centered on the line of flight of the bullet from the gun through the corresponding hole to the sandbox with a Gaussian or normal bellshaped distribution of bullet densities falling away from the peak of each moundWhen we use monochromatic light rather than bullets we note the following If the light hits the sandbox changed into a photoncounter surface we find that the size of the energetic impact is the same each time a photon hits the surface Photons of a given wavelength have a fixed energy A photon either is recorded at a point on the surface or not Whenever one is recorded the full parcel of energy has been detected at the surface Now if only one hole is open one gets the Gaussian mound result Most photons pass through the hole unscathed and arrive in a straight line at the photoncounter surface A Gaussian distribution peaked at that center is present because some photons are deflected slightly by the edges of the holeBut if two holes are open then one gets the famous interference pattern of light and dark interfering circles spreading from the centers on the photoncounter surface that were the peaks of the mounds seen when hole or hole was open Of course as Feynman points out there is no way to account for this oddness in classical physicsQuantum mechanics was built to account for the phenomenon The Schrdinger equation is a wave equation The wave that propagates from the photon gun is an undulating spherically spreading wave of probability amplitude The amplitude at any point in space and time is the square root of the probability that the photon will be found located at that point To obtain the actual probability the amplitude must be squaredA central feature of Schrdingers equation is its linearity If two waves are propagating the sum and dierences of those waves are also propagating It is the essential linearity of quantum mechanics that makes the next puzzle the link from quantum to classical worlds so dicult For a central puzzle of quantum mechanics becomes the relation between this odd quantum world of possible events where the possibilities can propagate but never become actual and the classical world of actual eventsA variety of approaches to the liaison between the quantum and classical realms exist The first is the Copenhagen interpretation which speaks of the measurement event when the quantum object interacts with a macroscopic classical object the measuring device and a single one of the propagating possibilities becomes actual in the measurement event thereby collapsing the wave function A second approach is the Everett multiworld hypothesis which asserts that every time a quantum choice happens the universe splits into two parallel universes No one seems too happy with the Everett interpretation And few seem very sure what the Copenhagen interpretations collapse of the wave function might really meanMeanwhile there are two other longstanding approaches to the link between the quantum and classical worlds The first is Feynmans famous sum over all possible trajectories or histories approach In quantum mechanics we are to imagine a given possible pathway of the photon from the photon gun through the screen with the two slits to the photoncounting surface For each pathway there is a welldefined procedure to assign an action This action can be thought of as having an amplitude and a phase and the phase rotates through a full circle pi many times along the pathway According to the Feynman scheme classical trajectories correspond to quantum pathways possessing minimal actionConsider says Feynman all the pathways that start at the photon gun and end up at the same point on the photoncounting surface Nearly parallel nearly straightline pathways have nearly the same action So when those pathways interact they have nearly the same phase and their interaction yields constructive interference which tends to build up amplitude Thus pathways that are near the classical pathway interact constructively to build up amplitude By contrast quirky crooked pathways between the photon gun and the same point on the counter screen have very dierent actions hence very dierent phases and interact destructively so their amplitudes tend to cancel The classical pathway therefore is simultaneously the most probable pathway over the sum of histories of all possible pathways and the pathway that requires the least actionThe result is beautiful but has two problems First Feynman assumes a continuous background space and time in his theory Quantum gravity as we will see cannot make that assumption in the first place Rather space or geometry is a discrete selfconstructing object on its own Thus achieving a smooth space and time is supposed to be a consequence of an adequate theory of quantum gravity If Feynmans sum over histories must assume a smooth background space and time then it cannot as such be taken as primitive in quantum gravity Second granting a continuous background space and time Feynmans sum over all histories still only gives a maximum of the amplitude for the photon to travel the classical pathway it never gives an actual photon arriving at the counting surface No more than any other does Feynman overcome the fundamental linearity of quantum mechanics We still have to collapse the wave function Despite these problems Feynmans results are brilliant and at least we see a link between the classical and quantum worlds if not yet actual photons striking countersBut there is an alternative approach to the link between the quantum and the classical worlds This possible approach is based on the wellestablished phenomenon of decoherence Decoherence arises when a quantumcoherent Schrdinger wave is propagating and the quantum system interacts with another quantum system having many coupled variables or degrees of freedom The consequence can be that the Schrdinger wave function of the first quantum system becomes entangled in very complex ways with the other complex quantum system which may be thought of as the environment Rather like water waves swirling into tiny granular nooks and crannies along a rugged fractal beach the initial coherent Schrdinger equation representing the initial quantum system swirls into tiny and highly diverse patterns of interaction with the quantum system representing the environment The consequence of this intermixing is decoherenceTo understand the core of decoherence one must understand that the exhibition of interference phenomena the hallmark of quantum mechanics noted in the doubleslit photon experiment requires that literally all the propagating possible pathways in Feynmans sum over histories that are to arrive at each point on the photoncounter surface do in fact arrive at that point If some fail to arrive the sum over all histories fails In eect if some of the phase information the core of constructive and destructive interference has been lost in the maze of interactions of the quantum system with its environment then that phase information cannot come to be reassembled to give rise to quantum interferenceDecoherence is accepted by most physicists For example in attempts to build quantum computers that can carry out more than one calculation simultaneously due to the linear features of quantum mechanics actual decoherence is currently a technical hurdle in obtaining complex quantum calculationsDecoherence then aords a way that phase information can be lost thereby collapsing the wave function in a nonmysterious fashion Thus some physicists hope that decoherence provides a natural link between the quantum and classical realms Notable among these physicists are James Hartle and Murray GellMann whose views can be found in GellManns The Quark and the Jaguar In essence Hartle and GellMann ask us to consider the quantum state of the universe and all possible quantum histories of the universe from its initial state Some of these histories of the universe may happen to decohere Hartle and GellMann argue that the decoherent histories of the universe where true probabilities can be assigned rather than mere amplitudes correspond to the classical realm Others have argued that decoherence itself can be insucient for classical behaviorIt is striking that there appear to be two such separate accounts of the relation between the quantum and classical worlds Feynmans sum over histories in a smooth background spacetime and decoherence For an outsider it is hard to believe that both can be correct unless there is some way to derive one from the other I will explore one such possibility below In particular I will explore the possibility that decoherence of quantum geometries is primary and might yield a smooth spacetime in which Feynmans account is secondarily correctAn Outsiders DoubtsI turn next to an outsiders grounds for doubts about some of the core propositions of quantum mechanics Roland Omnes in The Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics is at pains to argue that decoherence is the plausible route to classicity In his discussion two major points leap to attention The first concerns the concept of an elementary predicate in quantum mechanics Quantum mechanics is stated in the framework of Hilbert spaces which are finite or infinitedimensional complex spaces that is spaces comprised of finite or infinite vectors of complex numbers In eect an elementary predicate is a measurement about an observable that returns a value drawn from some set of possible values And so the first striking point is Omnes claim that all possible observables can be stated in Hilbert space The second striking point is Omnes claim that some observables cannot be observedThe first point is striking because it is not at all clear that all possible observables can be finitely stated in Hilbert space My issue here is precisely the same as my issue with whether or not the configuration space of the biosphere is finitely prestatable As I argued above there does not seem to be a finite prestatement of all possible causal consequences of parts of organisms that may turn out to be useful adaptations in our or any biosphere which arise by exaptation and are incorporated in the ongoing unfolding exploration of the adjacent possible by a biosphereIn quantum mechanics an observable corresponds to a mathematical operator that projects out the subspace of Hilbert space corresponding to the desired observable in a classical measurement context that allows detection of the presence or absence of the observable But the biosphere is part of the physical universe and the exapted wings of Gertrude the flying squirrel are manifestly observables albeit classical observables If we cannot finitely prestate the observable Gertrudes wings then we cannot finitely prestate an operator on Hilbert space to detect the presence or absence of Gertrudes wings In short there seems to be no way to prespecify either the quantum or classical variables that will become relevant to the physical evolution of the universeIt turns out that the above issues may bear on the problem of time in general relativity as Lee Smolin realized from our conversations and as I return to shortlyNow the second point Omnes follows up on it An observable requires a measuring device There are some conceivable observables for which the measuring device would be so massive that it would of itself cause the formation of a black hole Thus no information resulting from the measurement could be communicated to the outside world beyond the black holeA strange situation even if we could finitely prestate all possible observables only some observables can manage to get themselves observed in the physical universeWhat shall we make of conceivable observables that cannot in principle be observed More important it seems to this outsider is the following If observation happens by coupling a quantum system to some other system quantum or classical whereby decoherence occurs and in turn classicity arises because loss of phase information precludes later reassembly of all the phase information to yield quantum interference then there appears to be a relation between an observable being observed and the very decoherence by which something actual arises from the quantum amplitude hazeIf that is correct then only those observables that can get themselves observed can in principle become actual More it begins to seem imperative to consider the specific possible pairs of quantum systems that can couple and decohere for only thereby can such pairs become classical via decoherence This begins to suggest preferred histories of the universe concerning such comeasuring pairs of quantum systems Preferentially those comeasuring pairs of quantum systems that decohere and become classical will tend to accumulate due to the irreversibility of classicity Thereafter quantumclassical pairs of systems that cause decoherence of the quantum system will preferentially accumulate into classicityIf comeasuring yields classicity and classicity is irreversible the classical universe begins to appear to coconstruct itself In particular it is generally accepted that bigger systems that is systems with more coupled degrees of freedom decohere more rapidly when they interact than smaller systems If so this begins to refine the suggestion of preferred histories of the universe concerning comeasuring pairs of quantum systems toward a preference for the emergence of classical diversity and complexity If quantum systems with more coupled degrees of freedom irreversibly decohere more rapidly into classical behavior when they interact than smaller simpler systems then the kinetics of decoherence should persistently favor the irreversible accumulation of bigger more complex quantum systems rather than of smaller simpler quantum systemsChemistry should be an example Molecules are quantum objects yet flow into the chemical adjacent possible The adjacent possible explodes ever more rapidly as molecular diversity and hence molecular complexity increases Reactions of complex molecules are precise examples of the couplings of quantum systems whereby decoherence can happen Decoherence presumably happens more rapidly among complex reacting molecules than among very simple molecules or the same total number of mere atoms nucleons and electrons in the same total volume This hypothesis ought to be open to experimental test If confirmed the flow of possible quantum events into the chemical adjacent possible should in part be made irreversible by the decoherence of complex molecular species as they couple and react with one anotherIf the general property obtains that complex quantum entities can couple to and interact with other complex quantum entities in more ways than can simple systems and that the number of ways of coupling explodes faster than the diversity of entities and thus faster than the complexity of those quantum objects then decoherence should tend to lead to favored pathways toward the accumulation of complex classical entities and processes I return to these themes belowThe Problem of Time in General RelativityTo my delight I soon found myself coauthor on a paper with Lee Smolin concerning the problem of time in general relativity Lee had done the majority of the work but had taken very seriously my concern that one cannot finitely prestate the configuration space of a biosphereIn general relativity spacetime replaces space plus time A history becomes a worldline in spacetime But that worldline is a geometrical object in spacetime Time itself seems to disappear in general relativity to be replaced by the geometrical worldline object in spacetimeBut argued Lee with my name appended general relativity assumes that one can prestate the configuration space of a universe In that prestated configuration space a worldline is indeed merely a geometrical object What if one cannot prestate the configuration space of the universe If so one cannot get started on Einsteins enterprise even if general relativity is otherwise correct As concrete examples Lee pointed out that fourdimensional manifolds are not classifiableHow might one do physics without prestating the configuration space of the universe Lee postulated use of spin networks as described below with the universe constructing itself from some initial spin network In this picture time and its passage is real If there can be a framework in which time enters naturally and possibly there is a natural flow of time or an arrow of time preferentially from past to future then among other possible consequences we may be able to break the matterantimatter symmetry for antimatter can be stated as the corresponding matter flowing backward in time Break the symmetry of time in fundamental physics and you may buy for free the breaking of the symmetry between matter and antimatter If time flows preferentially from past to future matter dominates antimatter That would be convenient since matter does dominate antimatter and no one knows just whyWe will head in this directionSpin NetworksFor the sixty years following and the emergence of matrix mechanics and the Schrdinger formulation of quantum mechanics scant progress was made on quantum gravity Now in the past decade or so there are two alternative approaches string theory and spin networks Of the two string theory has captured the greatest attention I discuss it briefly belowSpin networks were invented by Roger Penrose three decades ago as a framework to think about a quantized geometry Quite astonishingly spin networks appear to have emerged from a direct attempt to quantize general relativity by Carlo Rovelli and Lee Smolin In outline part of the tension between quantum mechanics and general relativity lies in the very linearity of quantum mechanics and the deep nonlinearity of general relativityBuilding on work of Astekar and his colleagues Rovelli and Smolin proceeded directly from general relativity along somewhat familiar pathways of canonical quantization In outline general relativity is based on a metric tensor concerning spacetime The metric tensor is a x symmetric tensor It turns out that this tensor yields seven constraint equations The solutions of six of the seven have turned out to be spin networks The solution of the seventh equation would yield the Hamiltonian function hence the temporal unfolding of spin networks in a space x time quantum gravitySpin network theories can be constructed in dierent dimensions The two most familiar are for two spatial and one temporal or three spatial and one temporal dimension We will concern ourselves with three plus one spin networks for concreteness The minimal objects in a spin network are discrete combinatorial objects that constitute first a tetrahedron with four vertices and four triangular faces A tetrahedron represents a primitive discrete unit of geometry or space Integervalued labels are present on the edges and vertices of these tetrahedra The labels on the edges represent spin states The labels on the vertices represent intertwinors and concern how edges entering a vertex are connected to one another into and out of the vertexAnalytic work has associated an area with a face of a tetrahedron and a volume with its volume There is at present no way to represent the length of an edge connecting vertices On the other hand one can think of the integer values on the edges around a face of a tetrahedron as associated with the area of the tetrahedron such that larger integers correspond to larger areasA geometry is built up by minimal moves called Pachner moves in which a given tetrahedron can give rise to daughter tetrahedra o each face In addition several tetrahedra can collapse to a single tetrahedronThus we may picture an initial spin network say a single tetrahedron In analogy with chemistry and combinatorial objects the founder set of a chemical reaction graph and the adjacent possible in the chemical reaction graph we may consider the single initial tetrahedron as a founder set gamma Consider next all possible adjacent spin networks constructible in any single Pachner move Let these first adjacent possible spin networks lie in an adjacent ring gamma In turn consider all the spin networks constructible for the first time from the founder set in two Pachner moves hence constructible for the first time in one Pachner move from the gamma set of spin networks Let this new set be the gamma set of spin networksBy iteration we can construct a graph connecting the founder spin network with its Pachner move descendants Pachner move descendintsNPachner move descendentsEach spin network in each gamma ring represents a specific geometry subject to the constraint that two spin network tetrahedra that share one triangular face must assign the same spin labels to the common edges hence the same area to the common faceChanges in the values of spins on the edges that change the areas and volumes of the tetrahedra can be thought of as deforming the geometry so that it warps in dierent ways However it should be stressed that there is no continuous background space or spacetime in this discrete picture Geometry is nothing but a spin network and a change in geometry is nothing but a change in the tetrahedral structure of the spin network by adding or deleting tetrahedra or by changing the spin values on the edges of tetrahedraWithin quantum mechanics there is an appropriate way to consider the discrete analogue of Schrdingers equation namely a means over time of evolving amplitudes from an initial distribution In particular the appropriate means of evolving amplitudes concern what are called fundamental amplitudes which specify initial and final values of the integer values on edges before and after Pachner movesConsider a given graph linking spin networks from an initial tetrahedron in gamma outward as in a mandala to all daughter networks in gamma gamma gamma N where N can grow large without limitThe Emergence of a LargeScale Classical LimitI now describe one approach to thinking about quantum gravity and the emergence of a smooth largescale geometry based on this mandala and on Feynmans idea of a sum over all histories Endow the spin networks throughout with the same fundamental amplitudes thus the same law propagating amplitudes applies everywhere in the spin network mandala Begin with all amplitude concentrated in the initial spin network tetrahedron in gamma In this vision a unit of time elapsing is associated with a Pachner move such as a move from gamma to a point in gamma With analogy to Feynmans sum over all possible histories consider the set of all pathways that begin at the initial tetrahedron in gamma and end on a given specific spin network N time steps later for N That final spin network might lie in the gamma ring the gamma ring the gamma ring or any ring out to the gammaN ringHere is a hopeful intuition that may prove true If we consider the family of all histories beginning on gamma and ending in a specific spin network in the gamma N ring those pathways must be very similar and few in number By contrast if we consider all pathways length that begin on the gamma tetrahedron and end steps later on a specific spin network in the gamma ring after wandering all over the spin network mandala graph there may be many such pathways and they can be very dissimilar Now during the amplitude propagation along any pathway an action can be associated with each Pachner move hence we can with Feynman think about the constructive or destructive interference among the family of pathways steps long that begin on the gamma tetrahedron and end on any specific spin network Then the hopeful intuition is that those pathways that begin on gamma and end on a spin network member of the gamma N ring in Pachner moves will have very nearly the same action hence show strong constructive interference By contrast those pathways that begin on the gamma tetrahedron and end Pachner moves later on a specific spin network in the gamma ring will have very dierent actions hence show strongly destructive interferenceIf the constructive interference among the few pathways to ring N overwhelms any residual constructive interference in the inner ringssuch as ring due to the larger number of pathways from gamma to gamma then the hopeful concept is that amplitude will tend to accumulate in the gammaN ring Then goes the hope shared with Smolin the neighboring spin networks in the gammaN shell constitute nearly the same geometry and nearly the same action in the sum of histories reaching them which begins to suggest that a smooth largescale geometry might emergeFor this line of theory to succeed it is not actually necessary that amplitude preferentially accumulate in the outermost gammaN ring Rather it is necessary as N increases that there be some ring M where M is less than N but increases monotonically with N such that a suciently large number of alternative pathways with suciently similar phase end on members of the M ring that constructive interference is maximum for members of the M ring Further it is necessary that as N increases and M increases amplitude continue to accumulate on the Mth ringIn short the concept is that via constructive and destructive interference as amplitudes propagate in the mandala some largescale smooth geometry will pile up amplitude hence probability and a smooth classical geometry will emerge Here is at least one image of how a largescale smooth geometry might emerge from spin networks and constructive interferenceAt least three major caveats are required First no calculation has yet been carried out for such a model so such a theory may not work Second Feynmans sum over histories assumes a classical continuous space and time It may be entirely invalid to attempt to use a sum over histories argument in this quantum geometry setting Third assuming we can use Feynmans sum over histories we still have possible quantum geometries not an actual geometrySelfSelection of the Laws and Constants of NatureRecall the puzzle nay the deep mystery about what processes if any might have chosen the twenty constants in the standard model such that the universe happens improbably to be complex To answer this deep mystery we have at present the anthropic principle Lee Smolins concept of cosmic natural selection for black hole density and the hope to find the ultimate parameterfree theory that would not require multiple universes or a historical processWith caveats I now briefly describe a way that may be useful to begin to think about the emergence of the constants such that any universe would have a given set of constantsTuning the constants corresponds to tuning the laws of physics Is there a way to imagine a selftuning of a universe to pick the appropriate values of its constants to tune its own laws I think the answer may be yes And if the following is wrong in detail the pattern of thought may prove usefulIn the spin network mandala picture a J symbol present throughout the spin networks in the mandala generates an analogue of Schrdingers equation hence the means to propagate amplitudes in the graph of spin networks Thus a change in a J symbol would correspond to changing the laws of physics about how amplitudes propagateImportantly the fundamental amplitudes are an ordered listing of integers hence there is a family of all possible fundamental amplitudes Since each fundamental amplitude can be thought of as the law about propagating amplitudes among spin networks Louis Crane pointed out that there is an infinite family of all possible laws to propagate amplitude among spin networksThus imagine an infinite stack of our spin network mandalas in which each manadala is a graph from gamma the tetrahedron outward to gamma N for N allowed to be arbitrarily large of spin networks reachable in N steps by Pachner moves The mandala members of the infinite stack of mandalas dier from one another only in the fundamental amplitudes hence laws that apply to each mandala I concede it may be necessary to have a means to encode in each manadala the given fundamental amplitudes that apply to that manadalaNow consider how amplitudes propagate in each mandala from an initial state with all the amplitudes concentrated in the gamma tetrahedron And consider any two mandalas whose fundamental amplitudes are minimally dierent For some such adjacent mandalas with adjacent laws the small change in the law may lead to a large change in how amplitudes propagate in the mandalas For other pairs with minimal changes in the fundamental amplitudes or law the way the amplitude propagates throughout the mandala may be very slight Assuming this is true one intuitively imagines that the total system is spontaneously drawn to those tuned values of the fundamental amplitude laws where small changes in the laws make minimal changes in how amplitudes propagateA simple possible mechanism might accomplish this Imagine a sum of histories from an initial gamma tetrahedron in a mandala with some given fundamental amplitude laws thereby the initial and boundary conditions are specified where the pathways in that set of histories pass up and down the stack of mandalas such that the fundamental amplitude laws change as does the spin network and then consider the bundle of all such histories that end on a given spin network in a given gamma ring with given perhaps new fundamental amplitude laws In eect this conceptual move allows there to be quantum uncertainty not only with respect to spin networks along histories but also quantum uncertainty with respect to the law by which amplitude propagatesThen one can imagine a sum over all histories that by constructive interference alone picks those pathways hence fundamental amplitude laws that minimize the change in the ways amplitudes propagate Such pathways would have similar phase hence accumulate amplitude by constructive interference Then by mere constructive interference one can hope that such a process would pick out not only the history but also tune the law to the wellchosen fundamental amplitudes laws that maximized constructive interference Hopefully that constructive interference would pick out smooth largescale geometries like classical flat or near flat space In such a largescale classicallike space and time Feynmans familiar sum over histories that minimizes a least action along classical trajectories would emerge as a consequenceSmolin and I discuss this possibility in a second paper I find the idea attractive as a research program because it oers a way in which a known process constructive interference modified to act over a space of geometries and laws simultaneously chooses the law It is of course rather radical to suppose that there is quantum uncertainty in the law but it does not seem obviously impossibleOn an even grander scale particle physicists build the standard model from an abstract algebra called SU x SU x U One can imagine a similar research program that by constructive interference alone picks out the particles constants and laws of the standard model Presumably particles governed by suciently nearby laws would be able to interact hence undergo constructive or destructive interference thus picking the particles and the laws simultaneouslyThere is a further interesting feature for we appear to have in our mandala or mandalas a new arrow of time Allow that at any step any Pachner move can happen Some moves add tetrahedra A equal number delete tetrahedra Yet the number of spin networks in ring N is larger than the number of spin networks in ring N Statistically there are more ways to advance into ring N than to retreat from ring N into ring N Other things equal amplitude should tend to propagate outward from the gamma tetrahedron There is an analogy in chemical reaction graphs to the adjacent possible and the real chemical potential across the frontier from the actual to the adjacent possibleBut if so time enters asymmetrically due to the graph structure of the spin network mandala Then statistically time tends to flow in one direction from simpler toward more complex spin networks into the everexpanding adjacent possibleA Brief Comment on String TheoryString theory has gained very substantial attention as a potential theory of everything namely a theory that might link all four forces and all the particles of the standard model into a single coherent framework I do not write with even modest expertise on the subject Nevertheless it is possible that the concept of the law selecting itself via maximum constructive interference in a sum over all possible histories in a space of both spin networks and laws might possibly have relevance to string theory The description of string theory that I give draws heavily on Brian Greenes The Elegant UniverseAs is known qualitatively by many outside the confines of the physics community string theory began by giving up the picture of fundamental particles as zerodimensional point particles In its initial version in the place of point particles string theory posited onedimensional strings that might be open with two ends or closed loops with no free ends Among the fundamental ideas of string theory is the idea that the dierent particles and the dierent forces can all be thought of as dierent modes of vibration of such strings Because strings have finite length string theory can hope to overcome the infinities that emerge when attempts are made to marry point particle quantum theories with general relativity in a continuous spacetime In eect the finite length of the strings prevents consideration of space becoming infinitely curved at a point Thus string theory can dream of uniting quantum mechanics and general relativity and it has in fact produced the entity carrying the gravitational force the graviton in a natural wayCurrent string theory has gone beyond singledimensional strings and now considers twoorhigherdimensional entities called Mbranes The rough present state of the art has shown that there are at least five onedimensional string theories and Mbrane theory All of these theories appear to be linked as cousins of one another via various dualities among the theoriesString theories posit either elevenorfewerdimensional space and time with three of the spatial dimensions unfurled and large scale corresponding to our familiar threedimensional space The remaining dimensions are imagined as curled up on the Planck length scale in what are called CalabiYau spaces or more generally compactified moduli Compactification of an elevendimensional space and time can be thought of as a largescale threedimensional space and time but with the additional dimensions curled up at each point in the largescale threedimensional spaceCalabiYau spaces can have dierent topologies Consider as an analogy a long thin tube with two ends and a onehole torus like a donut These two are topologically dierent As a consequence closed onedimensional string loops can live on these surfaces in dierent ways Thus if you think of a string as a closed loop that loop might live on the long tube in two ways either wrapped around the tube one or more times or not wrapped around the tube but lying on the tubes surface like a rubber band lying on a surface By contrast consider the torus The closed string might wrap around the torus in either of two ways through the hole or around the torus In addition the string loop might live on the surface of the torus without wrapping either dimension Each of these dierent ways of being on the tube or torus and the corresponding modes of vibration constitute dierent particles and forces CalabiYau spaces are more complex than the tube or torus but the basic consequences are the same Dierent CalabiYau spaces or more generally dierent compactified moduli with dierent kinds of holes around which strings can wrap zero one or more times correspond to dierent laws of physics with dierent particles and forcesPhysicists have shown furthermore that one CalabiYau space can smoothly deform into another with a gentle tearing of space and time Hence the laws forces and particles can deform into one another in a space of laws forces and particles Within current string theory it appears that it is still not certain that there exists a CalabiYau space whose string or Mbrane inhabitants would actually correspond to the known particles and forces but hopes are highHowever even if there is a CalabiYau space whose strings and Mbranes do correspond to our known particles and forces string theorists have the diculty that it is not clear how the current universe happens to choose the correct CalabiYau space The familiar ideas on this subject include the existence of a multiverse and the weak anthropic principle For example one could imagine Lee Smolins arguments for choices of CalabiYau spaces that lead to fecund universes with a near maximum of black holes which are the birthplaces of still further universesThe parallel between spin networks with dierent fundamental amplitude laws and the family of string and Mbrane theories that can deform into one another is that in both theories we confront a family of theories having the property that dierent members of the family correspond to dierent particles forces and laws In both cases physicists do not at present have a theory to account for how in this embarrassment of riches our universe happens to pick the correct laws I therefore make the suggestion that the same pattern of reasoning that I described above a sum over histories of trajectories that vary both in configurations and in the laws which maximizes constructive interference might prove a useful approach In the string theory context one would consider a hyperspace of CalabiYau spaces in which neighboring CalabiYau spaces would propagate amplitudes from the same initial condition in dierent ways Presumably somewhere in the hyperspace of CalabiYau spaces small changes in CalabiYau spaces would yield small changes in how amplitudes propagate For other locations in the hyperspace of CalabiYau spaces small changes in the CalabiYau space would yield large dierences in how amplitudes propagate In the hyperspace of CalabiYau spaces where one CalabiYau space can deform into its neighbors it should be possible to construct a sum over all histories of trajectories between an initial and final state in the same or dierent CalabiYau space then seek such sums over histories that maximize constructive interference The hope is that maximizing constructive interferences would pick out the CalabiYau space corresponding to our particles and forces Presumably this would occur in the region of the hyperspace of CalabiYau spaces where small changes in the CalabiYau space yield the smallest changes in how amplitudes propagate In short maximization of constructive interference may be a useful principle to consider to understand how the universe chooses its lawsString theorists recognize the need to confront further major problems Most notably string theory posits a background spacetime in which strings and Mbranes vibrate But if string theory is to be the theory of everything including space and time then space and time cannot be assumed as a backdrop Thus a virtue of spin networks is that it aords the hope of a quantized geometry from the outset On the other hand particles and the three nongravitational forces have yet to be incorporated into a spin network pictureA Decoherence Spin Network Approach to Quantum GravityHowever the universe picks its presumably quantum laws somehow the classical realm emerges I noted above that current theory sees two approaches to linking the quantum and classical realms The first is based on Feynmans sum over histories but as a perturbative theory assumes a continuous background spacetime and does not get rid of the linear superposition of possibilities that is the core of quantum mechanics and interferenceWhat of the second approach decoherence The reality of decoherence is established If one is to take decoherence seriously and also to consider geometry constructing itself then presumably decoherence can apply to geometry as it constructs itself What would it mean to apply decoherence to quantum gravity itself to the vacuum to geometry itselfWell to an outsider the following seems possible If we are to conceive of an initial spin network say a tetrahedron and all possible daughter spin networks as well as all their possible daughter spin networks propagating amplitudes on the mandala then at any moment N steps away from moment more than one geometry is possiblenamely all those reachable in N Pachner movesWe seem to confront the same problem we confront with quantum systems coupling to quantum systems such as electrons coupling to organic molecules or to classical systems such as rocks These quantum systems can decohere Can quantum geometries become coupled with one another or dierent parts of one quantum geometry become coupled so to speak and decohereWhy not try the ideaI now discuss one possible approach to this issue The approach posits a quantum of action h to the generation of a tetrahedron hence a Planck energy and thus a Planck mass to a tetrahedron and decoherence setting in at a sucient mass and size scaleBy use of an equation suggested by Zurek relating the decoherence timescale Td to the relaxation timescale Tr of the system in which increasing mass and area increase the rate of decoherence in proportion to their product it can be qualitatively shown via suciently rough arguments that geometry may well be thought of as decohering and doing so on a length scale of about cm which is smaller than the Compton radius of the electron and even smaller than the radius of a nucleusNow there are some interesting features of this rough calculation First if we begin with an initial tetrahedron of geometry it can have four daughter tetrahedra In turn each daughter tetrahedron can have two or more daughter tetrahedra hence the initial spin network can grow exponentially in the number of tetrahedra before decoherence sets in This is a clue that a purely quantum account might be given of an initial exponential expansion of a universe starting with a single tetrahedron Thus it might be possible to do without the inflationary hypothesis of exponential expansion of a classical space in the early moments after the big bangSecond an initial exponential expansion of geometry might overcome as the inflationary hypothesis does the particlehorizon problem in cosmology in which we confront the puzzle of why parts of the universe that have been out of apparent causal contact since the big bang can be so similar If the initial expansion is exponential then slows to linear as in the inflationary hypothesis or perhaps in this purely quantum approach then the particlehorizon problem may disappearThird a purely quantum exponential expansion over many orders of magnitude should presumably yield a flat power spectrum over many size scales for quantum fluctuations in the earliest small fraction of a second of the life of the universe prior to the end of this exponential expansion when decoherence of geometry occursFourth we must consider when geometries decohere whether there may be geometries that are the slowest to decohere If dierent parts of a single spin network geometry can become coupled it is natural to assume that flat parts might decohere more slowly than distorted parts of that geometry Intuitively phase information can get lost more readily when two lumpy parts of a geometry couple than when two flat parts of a geometry couple Of course an explicit model exploring this is badly needed and entirely missing but in its absence lets make the assumption Given that then an initial exponential explosion of flat and warped geometry occurs until decoherence sets in on a length scale of something like cm At this point flat geometry wins because it decoheres most slowly Hence as soon as decoherence of geometry sets in space tends to be flat in the absence of matterBut even after decoherence sets in geometry is busy all the time trying to build geometry exponentially and everywhere while simultaneously decohering Now an interesting feature of the TdTr equation alluded to above is that whatever the exponential rate of expansion of geometry may be per Planck time unit the exponential rate of decoherence Td which grows as the mass times the size scale squared of the geometry increases until eventually the exponential rate of formation and exponential rate of decoherence of geometry must balance The exponential expansion of the universe is over However linear expansion by construction of geometry can continue The fastest linear construction of geometry from any tetrahedron would be at the speed of lightWhen the rate of geometry formation and decoherence balance geometry keeps building tetrahedra as fast as possible everywhere but flat geometry by hypothesis decoheres most slowly In the limit perhaps flat geometries do not decohere at all Then the geometry of the universe tends to be flat in the absence of matter as Einstein requires in general relativity And once again the flatness after exponential expansion may overcome a need for the inflationary scenario and solve the particlehorizon problemIt may be of interest that the assumption of an action h in the generation of each tetrahedron implies an expanding total energy in geometry itself the vacuum itself as geometry constructs itself Indeed one expects that the assumption of an action h per tetrahedron would lead to a uniform energy density a constant scalar quantity even as geometry grows Such an energy could be related to the cosmological constantIt may also be of interest that string theory posits extra dimensions that curl up on themselves to yield fourdimensional spacetime Could the decoherence of geometry aord a parallel way that extra dimensions can curl up And could the evergenerating possible geometries as they generate exponentially even as they decohere yield sucient extra degrees of freedom to correspond to the modes of oscillation of strings or Mbranes in six or seven extra dimensionsIt may be interesting that the energy content of geometry could be enormous compared to that of familiar particles of the same size scale That might allow the familiar particles with rest mass to borrow a tiny bit of the vacuum energy for their mass Such a possibility could hint that matter energy and geometry might be able to interconvert Perhaps dierent particles would be dierent kinds of topological knots in the spin network structure of geometry with interconvertible particles being nearby knot topologiesWe are obviously far from anything like a coherent theory that implements any of the intuitions above They remain at best mere suggestions for a research programCoconstructing ComplexityI began this chapter wondering why the universe is complex In place of the anthropic principle or Lee Smolins cosmic selection I have suggested one possible approach to the choices of the constants of nature by maximizing constructive interference over a sum of all histories through a space of both configurations and laws Even if that program were to succeed it does not necessarily yield a complex universe let alone one poised roughly between expansion and contractionMight we see ways to understand why the universe is complex Perhaps but merely perhaps I return to the thoughts earlier in this chapter that decoherence requires coupling systems and the loss of phase information If in general complex and highdiversity quantum systems with many coupled degrees of freedom lose phase information when they interact more rapidly than an equal number of simple lowdiversity quantum systems with the same total number of interacting parts then the comeasuring of entangled quantum systems should tend toward higher complexity diversity and classicity In short complexity and diversity would beget classicity irreversibly In turn this would lead to a preferred tendency toward a lockin of complexity and diversity There is a sense in which classical objects are like the constraints on the release of energy that permits work to be done Classical objects interacting with quantum objects lead to decoherence and more classicity Complex pairs of quantum objects that decohere readily or classical objects and those quantum objects that are caused to decohere readily when interacting with the classical object form preferred pairs that tend to decohere hence become frozen into classicity We begin to have an image of preferred pairs of quantum systems coupling and decohering hence an image of a complex and diverse universe constructing itself as it nonergodically invades the adjacent possible rather as a biosphere constructs itself And if more complexity and diversity means more comeasurement and faster decoherence of a wider variety of complex quantum systems in analogy with the concept that extracting work from increasingly subtle nonequilibrium systems requires increasingly subtle measuring and coupling devices the universe as a whole may persistently break symmetries as new entities come into existence and hence expand its diversity complexity and classicity as fast as possibleLoose arguments Yes Testable Here and there Wrong Probably Deeply wrong Maybe not Does this get the universe to the edge of expansion versus contraction or to a flat universe expanding forever more rapidly I would love it to be so Indeed I would love a view in which matter energy and geometry can all interconvert After all if geometry the vacuum has energy such interconversion does not seem impossible Do the considerations of this chapter require detailed models and supporting calculations to be taken as more than the merest suggestions Absolutely This chapter like much of Investigations is protoscience But science grows from serious protoscience and I take Investigations to be serious protoscienceWe enter a new millennium There will be time for new science to grow Chapter Autonomous AgentsSome wellspring of creation lithe in the scattered sunlight of an early planet whispered something to the gods who whispered back and the mystery came alive Agency was spawned With it the nature of the universe changed for some new union of matter energy information and something more could reach out and manipulate the world on its own behalf Selfish Yes But how does matter energy information and something else miraculous become selfish From that miracle grew a biosphereand we must surmise from that grow other biospheres scattered seeds and gardens across the cosmosPregnant in the birth of the universe was the birth of life Agency may be coextensive with life Life certainly burgeons nowhere without agency We all act on our own behalf In the Kantian form What must something be such that it can act on its own behalfI will hazard again my tentative answer baldly now then return to it An autonomous agent must be an autocatalytic system able to reproduce and able to perform one or more thermodynamic work cyclesThe thrashing E coli swimming upstream in a glucose gradient is an autocatalytic system able to reproduce In its swimming it is carrying out one or more thermodynamic work cycles Can I deduce this tentative definition from some more primary categories I do not know how At the beginning I jumpedmore realistically I struggledfor weeks searching for a constellation of properties that seemed promising in order to articulate something I sensed but could not yet say It has taken four more years to understand more of what I still can only partially say in these investigationsDefinitional Jumps and CirclesWhat of definitional jumps in science So a pause to look at such jumps to new clusters of concepts that whole cloth change how we carve up the world Consider Isaac Newton and his famous F MA force is equal to mass times acceleration It all seems sensible If a log lies on an iced pond and I push it it accelerates If I push harder it accelerates faster If there are two logs one on top of the other and I push the two accelerate less rapidly than if there were one logI make no hypotheses stated Newton Yet Poincar two centuries later argued that Newtons brilliant move was definitional The three terms F M and Aforce mass and accelerationargued Poincar admit no independent definitions Acceleration is independently definable by the metric concepts of distance motion time the rate of change of position with timevelocity and the rate change of velocity with timeacceleration But force and mass are said Poincar joined at the hip codefined one in terms of the other Mass is that which resists acceleration by force Force is that which induces acceleration when applied to a mass The equation F MA is a definitional circle according to Poincar Many physicists disagree with Poincar I tend to agree but then I am not a physicist so take careOn the other hand the great twentiethcentury philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein said something similar in his majestic Philosophical Investigations Wittgenstein came to his revolutionary investigations painfully ultimately rejecting his own earlier triumph in the Tractatus Indeed part of why I have so blatantly borrowed Wittgensteins title without my presumption to similar intellectual stature is that there is a parallel between Wittgensteins abandonment of the Tractatus and growing awareness of knowing as living a language game and a central theme of this Investigations that there may be a limit to the way Newton taught us to do science and a need to reformulate what we do when we and other agents get on with living a life As we will see in both cases it appears that something profound is going on in the universe that is not finitely prestatable Life and language games seem persistently open to radical innovations that cannot be deduced from previous categories and concepts I will only be able to discuss these issues more fully after we have encountered autonomous agents and their unfolding mysteriesIn his early Tractatus Wittgenstein had brought to conclusion the mandate of logical atomism from Russell Logical atomism sought a firm epistemological foundation for all knowledge in terms of privileged atomic statements about sense data The idea flowing from Hume to Berkeley to Kant then back to British empiricism was the following One might be mistaken in saying that a chair is in the room but one could hardly be mistaken in reporting bits and pieces of ones own awareness For example I am having the experience of a brown color I am aware of the note Aflat These statements were thought to record sense data and to be less susceptible to error than statements about the external world of chairs rocks and legal systems Logical atomism sought to reconstruct statements about the external world from logical combinations of atomic statements about sense data The Tractatus sought to bring that program to fruitionand nearly succeededIt was Wittgenstein himself who twenty years later junked the entire enterprise Philosophical Investigations was his laterlife revolution His revolution has done much to destroy the concept of a privileged level of description and paved the way to an understanding that concepts at any level typically are formed in codefinitional circles Newton was just ahead of his timeYou see even in the case of the physical chair the idea that we can reconstruct statements about chairs as equivalent to combinations of statements about sense data fails The failure is deep and will have unfolding resonances with the mysteries of autonomous agents The program to replace statements about physical objects with sets of statements about sense data requires logical equivalence Logical equivalence means that wherever a statement about a chair occurs at a higher level of description it must be possible to specify a list of statements about sense data whose truth are jointly necessary and suYcient for the statement about the chair to be true For example the statement There is a Windsor rocker in the living room must be implied by I seem to be seeing a brown surface with a given shape I feel a hard surface and also When I push the top of the shape I observe an oscillatory motion of the brown surfaceThe trouble is it appears to be impossible to finitely prespecify a set of statements about sense data whose truth is logically equivalent to statements about chairs What if the observer were colorblind or blind or deaf or not in the room but might enter the room wearing hobnailed boots fall on the chair and break it Could we finitely specify the list If I were to enter the room I would have the following sense data and if one who is redgreen colorblind were to enter the room he or she would have the following sense data and if the rocker were to be on a soft rug the sounds that would be heard by one who is Aflat tone deaf would To achieve this end we would have to be able to finitely prespecify something about a set of statements concerning atomic sense data statements whose truth would be necessary and suYcient to the truth of a statement about the Windsor chair in the living roomThe problem briefly is that there appears to be no finitely prestatable set of conditions about sense data statements whose truth is logically equivalent to any statement about a real physical chair in a living roomWittgenstein invented the concept of a language game a codefined cluster of concepts that carve up the world in some new way Consider he said legal language and try translating it to ordinary statements about human agents without using legal concepts So consider The jury found Henderson guilty of murder We understand this statement but do so in the context of law evidence legal responsibility trials guilt and innocence jury systems bribing jury members appeal processes and so forth Now try to translate the statement into a set of statements about ordinary human actions A group of twelve people were seated behind a wooden enclosure for several days People talked about someone having died of poison One day the twelve people left the room and went to another room and talked about what had happened Then the twelve people came back and one man stood up and uttered the words We find Henderson guilty of murderThere is no finitely prespecifiable list of statements about ordinary human actions whose truth would be necessary and suYcient for the truth of the statement that the jury found Henderson guilty of murderAnother example concerns the United Kingdom going to war with Germany There is no finitely prespecifiable set of ways this must happen Thus the queen one day after tea might betake herself to Parliament and cry We are at war with Germany Or the prime minister might in Parliament say Members by the authority of my oYce I declare that we are at war with Germany Or ten thousand irate football fans from Leeds might shoulder picks take to barges funnel in fury up the Rhine and attack football fans in Koblenz Or In short there is no prestatable set of necessary and suYcient conditions about the actions of individual humans for the United Kingdom to manage to go to war with Germany And may neither nation again find a way to make war on the other in the futureWittgensteins point is that one cannot in general reduce statements at a higher level to a finitely specified set of necessary and suYcient statements at a lower level Instead the concepts at the higher level are codefined We understand guilty of murder within the legal language game and thus in terms of a codefining cluster of concepts concerning the features noted abovelaw legal responsibility evidence trial juryUseful new concepts arise in codefining clusters It is fine that F MA is circular Poincar might say for the codefining circle is at the center of a wider web of concepts many of which have reference to the world hence the web of concepts touches articulates discriminates and categorizes the worldSo too did Darwin jump to a new definitional circle with his concept of natural selection heritable variation and fitness Many have worried that natural selection and fitness which is defined as an increased expected number of oVspring are a definitional circle Like F MA the definitional circle is virtuousSo too I jump to the tentative definition An autonomous agent is a system able to reproduce itself and carry out one or more thermodynamic work cycles Actually at this stage my own tentative definition is not circular because reproduce itself and work cycle are definable independently But as we delve further into the concept of an autonomous agent in succeeding chapters cyclic definitions arise concerning work propagating work constraints propagating organization task I hope that the circle is virtuous and brings us toward a new understanding of organization itselfIn short unpacking this definition will lead us into odd territory Part of the oddness is the question of just what is the proper mathematical form to describe an autonomous agent Is it a number hence a scalar A list of numbers hence a vector A tensor I think not An autonomous agent is a relational concept In a later chapter I will suggest a spare mathematical form for an agent derived from category theory This attempt is better than nothing but I am not persuaded that eVort is satisfactory for the mathematical mappings of category theory are themselves finitely prestatable and a biosphere I both fear and celebrate is not Somethings new are neededAutonomous AgentsWell lets have at it I begin with the cornerstone of thermodynamics the Carnot cycleSadi Carnot was a French engineer writing in the s The French had recently lost the Napoleonic Wars Waterloo had come and gone a certain famous statue to Wellington had been erected in London Carnot like others at the time realized that part of the success achieved by the English had to do with early industrial economic power The Brits had large numbers of steam pumps that were able to clear water from coal and iron mines allowing miners to work under bad but relatively dry conditions and extract coal and iron more eVectively than could their French counterparts The coal and iron in turn were worked into the machinery of the Industrial Revolution and cannons and also notably more steam pumps that could keep the mines in working condition I find it fascinating that the British system was an autocatalytic technology iron and coal fueled the manufacture of pumps that abetted the mining of iron and coalCarnot set about understanding the fundamentals of the extraction of mechanical work from thermal energy sources The result of his eVort was an analysis of an idealized device to extract mechanical work from heat the Carnot cycle Carnot titled his work An Investigation on the Motive Force of HeatA second point of fascination is that Carnot carried out his crucial analysis just as steam was becoming established as a source of mechanical work It is almost certainly not a coincidence that the impulse to investigate the central nature of autonomous agents arises just as we are on the threshold of creating such molecular systems Science technology and art tumble into the adjacent possible in roughly equal and yoked paceFigure shows the essentials of Carnots idealized machine There are two heat reservoirs one hotter than the other T T Between the two heat reservoirs is a cylinder with a piston inside The space between the top of the piston and the head of the cylinder is filled with an idealized working gas which can be compressed and can expand As a real and certainly an idealized gas is compressed the gas becomes hotter as the gas expands it becomes coolerI will modify the Carnot machine in one central way which does not alter but rather makes explicit an important feature of the actual working of the Carnot machine I will attach a red handle to the cylinder as shown in Figure The Carnot cycle begins with the piston pressed up near the top of the cylinder the working gas is compressed and hot indeed it is as hot as the high temperature T You will operate the machine You pull on the red handle sliding the cylinder frictionlessly into contact with the hightemperature reservoir T You then let go of the red handle and allow the working gas in the cylinder to expand thereby pushing the piston downward away from the head of the cylinder in the first part of the power stroke of the Carnot engineAs the power stroke initiates the working gas expands and starts to cool However thanks to the fact that the cylinder is now in contact with the hot thermal reservoir heat flows into the cylinder from T and maintains the working gas almost at the constant temperature T Indeed if the Carnot engine is operated slowly enough the temperature remains constant Such slow operation is said to be reversible If the engine is operated more rapidly hence irreversibly the temperature is held nearly constant during this part of the power stroke thus this section of the power stroke is called the isothermal expansion portion of the Carnot work cycleIt is not only convenient but central to understanding a Carnot engine to plot the state of the system in a Cartesian coordinate system in which the xaxis corresponds to the volume of the working gas while the yaxis corresponds to the pressure of the gas Figure The work cycle began with the piston near the top of the cylinder the working gas hot and compressed As the isothermal expansion phase of the power stroke happens the pressure falls slightly while the volume increases appreciably The corresponding segment of the work cycle connects the starting position in Figure position to position by a line segment representing the simultaneous values of volume and pressure during the isothermal expansion part of the power strokeYou initiate the second part of the power stroke by pushing on the handle and moving the cylinder out of contact with the hot T reservoir to a position between the two heat reservoirs touching neither You immediately let go of the handle The working gas continues to expand pushing downward on the piston and moving it away from the head of the cylinder However because the cylinder is out of contact with T and the working gas is expanding the working gas gets noticeably cooler so pressure drops appreciably while volume increases slightly This part of the power stroke is called adiabatic expansion In Figure the adiabatic expansion step carries the system from step to step the end of the power stroke a point where the pressure is at the lowest point and the volume of the working gas is at the highest point of the work cycleNow in order to return the Carnot engine to its initial state in Figure such that the working gas can again expand and do mechanical work on the piston work must be done on the engine to bring the piston back up to its position near the head of the cylinder and to recompress and reheat the working gas so that its temperature and pressure values or state correspond to state If the work done on the Carnot engine simply retraced the exact pathway from step to step to step at least as much work would have to be done on the Carnot engine as the engine released in the power stroke in going from to to If so no net work would be carried out by the Carnot engine on the external worldInstead of retracing the power stroke pathway the Carnot engine and all heat engines use a simple trick You will do it At step the end of the power stroke you push on the handle pushing the cylinder into contact with the lowtemperature reservoir T Indeed you have arranged things such that at the end of the power stroke the working gas is itself at this lower temperature TWith the cylinder in contact with T you now run around to the base of the cylinder where a stout handle is attached to the piston and extends beyond the cylinders base You push on the handle pushing the piston upward in the cylinder thereby compressing the working gas As you do this work on the piston the compressing gas tends to heat up But thanks to contact with the lowtemperature reservoir the heat generated by compression in the working gas diVuses into the cool T reservoir holding the working gas only slightly warmer than T Thus volume decreases appreciably while pressure increases slightlyThe point of this trick is that it requires less work to compress a gas that remains cool than one that heats up Because the working gas is held at nearly a constant temperature T this part of the compression stroke is called isothermal compression and it carries the system in its volumepressure state space from position to position in Figure At the end of the isothermal compression stroke you do your part again You pull on the handle pulling the cylinder out of contact with the cool T reservoir to a position between T and T touching neither Then you return to push on the handle connected to the piston further compressing the working gas Due to the compression of the working gas and the fact that it is not in contact with the cool T reservoir the working gas heats up so the pressure increases appreciably while the volume decreases slightly as the gas is compressed until the initial state of hot compressed gas step is achieved The work cycle is now complete The connected set of four lines in Figure from step to to to to depicts the sequence of pressure volume states of the working gas around the work cycleI have emphasized the role of you and the red handle in carrying us through the work cycle In a real engine of course the role of the red handle is carried out by various gears rods escapements and other mechanical devices that serve an essential role The handle and you or the gears rods and escapements literally organize the flow of the recurrent process I will return to this organization of the flow of process in a machine or an autonomous agent The Carnot cycle is involved with the organized release of thermal energy in achieving recurrent mechanical work The organization of work is essentialand will be centralto thinking about what occurs in an autonomous agent Indeed part of what we need is a way of characterizing the organization of real processes in the nonequilibrium world I do not think we have as yet an adequate concept of organizationThe first question I want to raise about the Carnot cycle is this Why is it a cycle There is a clear sensible answer The Carnot cycle operates in a cycle as does a steam engine gasoline engine or electric motor precisely because at the completion of one cycle the total system is returned to the same initial state as at the start of the cycle Because of this the organization of the process achieved by the actual gears rods and escapements that coordinate the relative motion of the parts of the engine has returned to the initial configuration from which with no further ado the system can again perform a work cycle Thus in the case of the Carnot engine the system performs mechanical work on the piston in a work cycle that in net transfers heat from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir At the end of the cycle the Carnot engine returns to the initial state with the piston raised and filled with hot compressed gas at the temperature of the hot reservoir The Carnot engine is all set as a total organization to receive another input of heat energy and perform another work cycleSuppose that there were no cycle For example a cannon fires a cannonball that hits a standing steel beam that is knocked over and hits a lever arm tossing a ball on its opposite end into the air which then falls to the ground and stops To get the contraption to do it again would require that somehow the cannon be reloaded the steel beam be reset on end the lever arm to be reset with a ball on its other end Where is all this organization of processes and events to come from I will return to these issues in the next chapter but notice for now that the cyclic organization of processes in the Carnot the steam the gas and the electric engines achieve the requisite organization precisely because the system works as a cyclic process A second issue concerns a wellknown feature of the Carnot engine that is very much worth comment here If the sequence of steps is run in the reverse directions so that the engine is run from state to to to to the Carnot engine is not performing as a pump at all It is instead performing as a refrigerator Run in the reverse direction the Carnot engine uses mechanical work to pump heat from the cool reservoir T to the hot reservoir T making T coolerNow heat does not spontaneously flow from cooler to hotter objects making the cooler objects even cooler So two points leap to attention here First the same device the Carnot engine can be a pump or be a refrigerator depending upon the order of the operations In fact I am cheating a bit for the organization of gears and escapements would diVer in achieving the sequence of states versus But essentially the same machine can perform two very diVerent functions or tasks pumping in one case cooling in the otherThe third point of course concerns spontaneous processes and nonspontaneous processes It took more than fifty years from Carnots work to really begin to understand thermodynamicsthe first law conservation of energy the famous and mysterious second law and its handmaiden entropy the third law concerning a zero temperature at which molecular motions stopand for the invention of statistical mechanics to connect thermodynamics and Newtonian mechanicsSome processes occur spontaneously some conceivable processes do not One of the most obvious cases is that if a hot gas is in contact with a cold gas the two will in due course come to be the same temperature Heat spontaneously diVuses from the hot to the cold object cooling the former warming the latter In statistical mechanics we think of hot as corresponding to atoms moving rapidly hence with high kinetic energy When these highkineticenergy atoms interact with slowermoving sets of atoms the collisions transfer kinetic energy to the slowermoving atoms speeding them up and slowing down the fastermoving atoms Eventually the atoms in the two sets come to have the same statistical distribution of motions hence kinetic energy and hence temperature where temperature is now understood to correspond to the average kinetic energy of the particles in the systemThe apparently mysterious second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a system is either constant or increases The modern understanding of entropy can be stated roughly with the help of the concept of a Ndimensional phase space Consider an isolated closed thermodynamic system say an ideal gas in a thermos bottle Let there be N gas particles in the bottle Now each particle is in motion in real threedimensional space therefore we can pick an arbitrary threedimensional coordinate system with length width and height x y and z We can note the current position of any particular particle in the bottle at any moment on each of the three positional coordinates In addition to having a position each particle may be in motion it may have a velocity and an associated momentum in some direction in the bottle Using Newtons vectorial composition of forces rules we can decompose the motion of the real particle into its motions in the x direction the y direction and the z direction The momentum in each of these directions is just the mass of the particle times its velocity in that direction Newtons vector composition rule says that we can recover the motion of the initial particle by constructing the obvious parallelogram that adds the x y and z velocity or momentum vectors back togetherSo for each particle we can represent its position and momentum in three spatial directions by numbers We have N particles in the bottle so we can represent the current positions and momenta of all N particles at any instant in time by N numbers DiVerent combinations of positions and velocities now correspond to diVerent sets of N numbers And as the N particles in the bottle collide and exchange momenta bouncing oV in new combinations of directions with new combinations of velocities according to Newtons three laws of motion the N numbers representing the system at each moment change in time through some succession of N numbers If we think of all the possible values of the positions and velocities of the N particles in the bottle that set of possible values is the Ndimensional phase space of our system The system starts at some single combination of N numbers hence a single state in the phase space Over time as positions and momenta change the N numbers change and the system flows along a trajectory in phase spaceNow here is the heart of the second law Some of the positions in the Ndimensional phase space correspond to states in which all the particles are more or less uniformly spread throughout the bottle and are moving with more or less the same velocities Other positions in the Ndimensional phase space correspond to unusual situations in which all the particles are located near the top of the bottle are along the walls of the bottle are moving in the same direction in the bottle and so forthConsider mathematically breaking up the Ndimensional phase space into a very large number of tiny Ndimensional cubes that together add up to the entire Ndimensional phase space If the cubes are small enough then each cube corresponds to a quite similar set of states One cube might correspond to all the particles flowing downward in the bottle another cube might correspond to a near uniform distribution of positions and momentaIt is easy to see intuitively that there are many more combinations of positions and momenta that correspond to nearly uniform positions of the particles and their motions scattered in all possible directions than there are combinations of positions and momenta that correspond to all the particles being located in a specific small region of the bottle In order to quantify this intuition statistical mechanics counts the numbers of small Ndimensional cubes corresponding to each such macroscopic state of the gas Vastly many more small cubes correspond to the macrostate in which particles are nearly uniformly distributed and are moving in all the possible directions with velocities bunched around an average velocityhence kinetic energythan for any other macrostate such as the macrostate corresponding to all the particles being located near the top of the bottleWe are almost home free We need one more premisethe famous ergodic hypothesis This hypothesis asserts that the trajectory of states leading from the initial state in a long stringlike walk will over time spend as much time in any small N cube as in any other cube In short the ergodic hypothesis assertsindeed assumesthat the system will wander around its phase space such that after a long time it will have spent as large a fraction of its time in any one tiny cube as any other cubeBut now we are home free Since vastly many more small cubes correspond to the nearly uniform distribution of particles moving in all possible directions but bunched around an average velocity it follows from the ergodic hypothesis that the system will have spent most of its time in this equilibrium macrostateThe second law in its modern understanding is simply the statement that an isolated thermodynamic system will tend to flow away from improbable macrostatescorresponding to very few of our tiny Ndimensional cubesand flow into and spend most of its time in the equilibrium macrostate for no better reason than that that macrostate corresponds to vastly many small N cubes in the entire Ndimensional phase space The increase of entropy in the second law is nothing but the tendency of systems to flow from less probable to more probable macrostatesThe physical concept of entropy of a macrostate is understood since Ludwig Boltzmann in the last century to be proportional to the logarithm of the number of small Ndimensional cubes that correspond to that macrostate The increase of entropy in spontaneous processes is then the tendency to flow from macrostates comprised of a small numbers of Ndimensional cubes or microstates to macrostates comprised of a very many microstatesOur next step in thinking about autonomous agents requires us to consider again the concept of a catalytic task space and the character of autocatalytic sets in the context of catalytic task space In the first chapter I described the basic framework due to Alan Perelson and George Oster of an abstract shape space where each point would represent a molecular shape Shape space has at least the three spatial dimensions of length height and width but in addition it has properties reflecting the features of clusters of atoms that contribute to an eVective molecular shape that is to those features that collectively might be recognized by another molecule that bound the shape in question Such additional molecular features may include electric charge dipole moment hydrophobicity or other features At present it is a reasonable guess that shape space is between five and seven dimensional If true this would not mean that there are five familiar features three spatial and two others that constitute the dimensions of shape space Rather some odd combination of several physical propertiespartially charge partially dipole moment or partially hydrophobicity and partially dipole momentmight be the dimensions that matterIn any case we are to consider a bounded shape space with maximum and minimum values for each axis A shape is a point in shape space Thus a molecular feature on a virus antigen an epitope is a point in shape space An antibody might bind that epitope and a family of similar shapes filling a ball in shape space As remarked above very diVerent molecules can have eVectively the same shape so endorphin and morphine both bind the same endorphin receptor A finite number of balls will cover shape space and the immune repertoire of perhaps a hundred million antibodies may well cover shape spaceCatalytic task space you recall simply applied the concept of shape space to catalysis A point in catalytic task space now represents a catalytic task A given chemical reaction constitutes a catalytic task As in shape space similar reactions constitute similar catalytic tasks As in shape space diVerent reactions can constitute essentially the same catalytic task An enzyme covers some ball in catalytic task space comprising the set of reactions it can catalyze And as noted before according to transition state theory a catalytic task corresponds to a catalyst binding the distorted hence highenergy molecular configuration corresponding to the transition state of a reaction with high aYnity and binding the substrate and product states with in general lower aYnityIn terms of catalytic task space what is a collectively autocatalytic set Consider a simple case Two peptides A and B form a collectively autocatalytic set if A catalyzes the formation of B from two of Bs fragments while B catalyzes A from two of As fragments Then consider two balls in catalytic task space the first ball covered by A constitutes the catalytic task in which two fragments of B are ligated to form B The second ball covered by B constitutes the catalytic task in task space in which two fragments of A are ligated to form AThe first feature of a collectively autocatalytic set is what I call catalytic closure Every reaction that must find a catalyst does find a catalyst The formation of A requires B and the formation of B requires A It is important to notice that this closure in catalytic task space is not local there is no single reaction in this collectively autocatalytic set that by itself constitutes the closure in question In a clear sense the catalytic closure is a property of the whole systemA second feature to notice is that A and B as catalysts do not by themselves constitute the closure in question A and B might catalyze a variety of reactions In particular if B is presented with the two proper fragments of A call them A and A then B will ligate A and A to form A But if B were presented with other substrates say Q and R then B might catalyze a reaction transforming Q and R into two other molecular species S and T Similarly A as a catalyst will ligate two proper fragments of B B and B to form B But A if confronted with two other substrates say F and G might catalyze their ligation to form a single third molecule HWhile the set A B A A B B is collectively autocatalytic forming more A and B from a substrate pool of A A B and B it is not the case that the set A B Q R F and G is collectively autocatalytic for the products of the reactions catalyzed by A and B namely S T and H are not themselves the catalysts A and BIn short the closure of catalytic tasks requires specification of the catalytic tasks themselves plus the specific substrates whose products here A and B constitute the very catalysts that carry out the catalytic tasks in questionThe closure of an autocatalytic set and set of catalytic tasks has a kind of dualism From the point of view of the molecules involved the specific catalytic tasks constitute the avenues of release of chemical energy by which the molecular system reproduces itself The tasks coordinate the flow of atoms among the molecules whereby the set reforms itself From the point of view of the tasks the molecular species manage to carry out the tasks repeatedly with no further molecular species being necessary to carry out the tasks The molecules carry out the tasks the tasks coordinate or organize the processes among the moleculesThe coordination aVorded by the catalytic tasks that are jointly present and fulfilled is highlighted if we recall that in general two molecular species say A and A might undergo a variety of diVerent reactions that form in addition to A perhaps E L M P and other molecular species The specific catalytic task that carries A and A to A in the presence of a catalyst B speeds that specific reaction in comparison to the alternative reactions forming E L M and P Thus the closure of the catalytic tasks substrates and catalysts A B A A B B achieves a coordination or organization of the flow of matter and energy into the autocatalytic systemThe organization achieved by the closure of catalytic tasks is similar to the organization achieved by the gears and escapements together with the rest of the idealized Carnot engine The flow of process is marshaled into an organized whole In the case of the autocatalytic set the set reproduces itself It also seems worth stressing that this closure in catalytic task space is a new concept with real physical meaning It is a matter of objective fact whether or not a physical reaction system achieves catalytic closure the hypothetical AB system above and any freeliving cell achieves catalytic closureA final preliminary will bring us to our attempted definition of an autonomous agent This preliminary is based on the distinction noted above between spontaneous and nonspontaneous chemical reactions At equilibrium the net rate of formation or destruction of each molecular species is zero aside from small fluctuations that damp out Thus if two molecular species X and Y interconvert the equilibrium is attained at that ratio of X and Y concentrations at which Y converts to X as fast as X converts to Y If the reaction is displaced in one direction say there is a higher X concentration than the equilibrium ratio then the spontaneous or exergonic reaction proceeds in the direction toward equilibrium that reduces the excess of X concentration Figure All spontaneous chemical reactions if coupled to no other source of energy are exergonic On the other hand if some other free energy source is coupled to the reaction the reaction can be driven beyond equilibrium by using some of the energy source Reactions that are driven beyond equilibrium by addition of free energy are called endergonic Thus X might convert to Y and this reaction might be coupled to another source of free energy such that the steady state concentration of Y is much higher than the normal equilibrium XY ratio Figure In the Carnot cycle completion of the work cycle involved the cylinder piston system doing exergonic work on the external world during the power stroke then the outside world doing work on the cylinder piston system when you pushed on the piston to recompress the working gas The Carnot cycle links mechanical and thermal energy sources into a work cycle A chemical reaction network with a work cycle will have to link spontaneous exergonic and nonspontaneous endergonic reactions into the chemical analogue of a work cycle Like the cyclic Carnot engine the chemical analogue will have to work in a cycle of states like the cycle of the Carnot cycle Further in order for the cycle to operate at a finite rate hence irreversibly the autonomous agent must be an open thermodynamic system driven by outside sources of matter or energyhence foodand the continual driving of the system by such food holds the system away from equilibriumIn this light think again of the Ghadiri autocatalytic system the aminoacid sequence A that ligates two fragments A a aminoacid fragment and A a aminoacid fragment into A This reaction is purely exergonic The reaction proceeds from the substrate fragments A and A to form the product molecule A and approaches the equilibrium ratio of substrates to product Ghadiris autocatalytic system is wonderful but merely exergonic It does not achieve a work cycle In general autocatalytic and collectively autocatalytic systems can be purely exergonic In any such case no work cycle is achievedNow we can return to my jumpedto definition An autonomous agent is a reproducing system that carries out at least one thermodynamic work cycle That bacterium sculling up the glucose gradient flagellum flailing in work cycles is busy as hell doing it reproducing and carrying out one or more work cycles So too are all freeliving cells and organisms We do in blunt fact link spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes in richly webbed pathways of interaction that achieve reproduction and the persistent work cycles by which we act on the world Beavers do build dams yet beavers are just physical systemsBut Reza Ghadiris example of an autocatalytic peptide doesnt make the grade nor does Gunter von Kiedrowskis autocatalytic hexamer DNA or collectively autocatalytic set of two DNA hexamers All these systems are merely exergonic No work cycle is performedNow that we have stated our proposed definition of an autonomous agent it is not too hard to imagine a chemical realization In Figure I show a hypothetical molecular autonomous agent Given visualization of a first case I expect that we will be constructing molecular autonomous agents within a few yearsFigure our first example of a candidate molecular autonomous agent is constructed to link with two further molecular systems the exergonic autocatalytic system developed by Gunter von Kiedrowski based on ligation of two DNA trimers by their complementary hexamer Here the hexamer is simplified to CCCGGG and the two complementary trimers are GGG CCC Left to its own devices this reaction is exergonic and in the presence of excess trimers compared to the equilibrium ratio of hexamer to trimers will flow exergonically toward equilibrium by synthesizing the hexamer Because the hexamer is itself the catalyst for the reaction the synthesis of hexamer is autocatalyticThe first additional system consists in pyrophosphate PP a highenergy dimer of monophosphate that breaks down to form two monophosphates P P Like any reaction the reaction converting PP to P P has an equilibrium hence an equilibrium ratio of PP and P In the presence of excess PP compared to equilibrium the reaction flows toward equilibrium by the spontaneous cleavage of PP to yield P PMy purpose in invoking the exergonic conversion of PP to P P is to utilize the loss of free energy in this exergonic reaction to drive the DNA trimerhexamer reaction beyond its own equilibrium leading thereby to an excess synthesis of the CCCGGG hexamer when compared to its equilibrium concentration Thus the excess synthesis of the hexamer which would not occur spontaneously is driven endergonically by being coupled to the exergonic breakdown of PP to P P Figure In short the exergonic breakdown of PP to P P supplies the free energy to drive the excess buildup of CCCGGG concentration beyond its own equilibrium with respect to its trimer substrates GGG and CCCThe excess synthesis of CCCGGG constitutes excess reproduction of the hexamer autocatalytic reaction product beyond that which would occur without the coupling to the additional PP free energy source Thus the system is reproducing better with the coupling to PP than without the couplingAnother point to note is that the coupling of the breakdown of PP to P P with the excess synthesis of the DNA hexamer compared to the equilibrium concentration of the DNA hexamer means that energy is stored within the system This is true because the excess concentration of the hexamer DNA compared to its equilibrium could in principle be released by degradation of the hexamer to the two trimer substrates releasing that stored free energy as this reaction couple flowed toward its own equilibrium ratio of hexamer and trimers Thus the coupling to the PP to P P reaction means that the autonomous agent stores energy internally Later in evolution such internally stored energy can be used to drive reactions that correct errors as in DNA repair in contemporary cells I am glad to thank Phil Anderson and indirectly John Hopfield for this pointOnce the pyrophosphate PP is cleaved to form P P as this reaction flows toward its own equilibrium ratio of PP to P that free energy is used up In order to have a renewed internal supply of the free energy needed to synthesize excess hexamer it is convenient to resynthesize pyrophosphate from the two monophosphates P P Ill return below to the meaning of convenient for in a general sense the convenience reflects the organization of processes that sustains an agent and that organization is not convenient it is essentialResynthesis of PP from P P requires the addition of free energy This is true because we used the exergonic breakdown of PP to P P to drive the excess synthesis of CCCGGG Now we need to add energy to resynthesize PP from P P To do so I invoke an additional source of free energy in the form of an electron e which absorbs a photon hv is driven endergonically to an excited state e and falls back exergonically to its lowenergy state e in a reaction that is coupled to the synthesis of PP from P PThe point of this third reactioncouple is clear PP is resynthesized from P P so that PP can continue to drive the excess synthesis of the DNA hexamer CCCGGG Overall the total system of linked reactions is exergonicthere is an overall loss of free energy that is ultimately supplied by the incoming photon hv plus the substrates GGG and CCC Thus we are not cheating the second lawLets return to the Carnot cycle where I had you pushing and pulling on the handle and on the piston itself during the work cycle We noted that in a real engine you would not be busy pushing and pulling Your role in organizing the processes would be taken by gears escapements rods connectors bearings and other bits of machineryI now invoke the analogue of the gears rods and connectors in the form of hypothetical molecular couplings that control the reactions I have already invoked Specifically I will assume that the hexamer CCCGGG is the catalyst that couples ligation of the two trimers GGG CCC to the exergonic breakdown of PP to P P My second assumption is that monophosphate P binds to the hexamer and facilitates the reaction Thus I am assuming that P is an allosteric enhancer of the reaction Allosteric means that P binds to a site on the enzyme here the hexamer other than the hexamers own binding site for the substrates Allosteric enhancers and inhibitors are common in biological systems Here P might bind to the sugarphosphate backbone of the DNA hexamer This coupling implies that as PP breaks down to form P P the monophosphate P will feed back to further activate the hexamer enzyme making the catalysis of hexamer formation even more rapid Just such a positive feedback of a reaction product on the enzyme forming it occurs in the famous glycolytic pathway that is the core of metabolism in your cells In fact under appropriate experimental conditions this positive feedback coupling can cause the glycolytic pathway to undergo sustained temporal oscillations in the concentrations of the glycolytic metabolitesFinally I will invoke a few more couplings I assume that one of the trimers CCC is the catalyst that couples the exergonic loss of free energy from the activated electron e to e with the resynthesis of PP from P P And I invoke an allosteric inhibition of this catalysis by PP itself Thus when PP is in high concentration it tends to inhibit its own resynthesis But when PP concentration falls the inhibition on PP resynthesis is removed and PP is resynthesized The whole molecular contraption our first hypothetical autonomous agent is shown in Figure One of the first things to note about our hypothetical autonomous agent is that it constitutes a previously unstudied class of chemical reaction networks The behavior of exergonic autocatalytic and crosscatalytic systems is beginning to be studied The behavior of linked exergonic and endergonic reaction networks is the very stuV of intermediate metabolism and energys biochemical transduction studied for years by biochemists But to date no one has begun to study linked reaction networks in which autocatalysis is coupled to linked exergonic and energonic reactions So we are entering an entirely new domainThus our molecular autonomous agent constitutes a system with two essential features of living systems selfreproduction and metabolism However my insistence that an autonomous agent carries out a work cycle refines the generally understood concept of a metabolism to include the requirement that the metabolism carries out a work cycleThe second feature to note is that our autonomous agent is necessarily a nonequilibrium system Free energy here in the form of the photon hv and the trimer substrates is taken in and used to drive the linked synthesis of PP and excess DNA hexamer There is no agency at equilibrium The excess synthesis of DNA hexamer constitutes excess replication of the hexamer by virtue of the coupling of the trimerhexamer synthesis to the PP P P cycle of reactions which as noted next constitute a chemical engineThe third feature to note is the work cycle performed by the agent The simplest way of seeing the work cycle here is in the behavior of the PP P P reaction In the Carnot cycle the working gas cycles from compressed and hot to less compressed and cool back to compressed and hot In our hypothetical autonomous agent there is a macroscopic cycle of matter from PP to P P via the reaction forming DNA hexamer and back around to PP via the reaction with the highenergy electron The macroscopic cycling of matter around this cycle is the engine at work I am grateful to Peter Wills for this clarification of the concept of a chemical motor In addition depending upon the details of the kinetic constants our autonomous agent may literally show an oscillatory concentration cycle in which PP concentration begins high and falls as P P is formed then the high PP concentration is reformed by use of the photonenergized exergonic e e reaction Thus the PP P P reaction embedded in the autonomous agent constitutes a chemical engine in which there is a macroscopic net flux of matter around the PP P P cycle which is operating displaced from equilibrium as it is driven by addition of energy from the photon hv and addition of the two DNA trimers and as energy is drained oV to drive excess synthesis of the DNA hexamerThe fourth thing to note about the autonomous agent is that like the Carnot engine the steam engine the gas engine and the electric engine the autonomous agent works in a cycle At the end of the cycle the system is poised to cycle again A repeating organization of process is achieved And next just as the Carnot engine run backward is a refrigerator and not a pump if the reactions of the autonomous agent were run backward the PP P P engine would run in the reverse direction This is because all reaction couples would be displaced from equilibrium the opposite way and the analogue of throwing the gears in reverse namely reversing in sign the positive and negative activator and inhibitor couplings to the two proper enzymes would convert the excess energy stored in the above equilibrium concentration of hexamer into production of the two trimers and the resynthesis of PP from P P Were the release of the photon hv a readily reversible step the excess of PP would drive emission of a photon by the excited electron thus returning the electron to the initial unexcited stateIn short if the autonomous agent is run backward the autonomous agent melts down into its foodstuV Run backward the system is not an autonomous agent for it does not reproduce itself and perform a work cycle Run backward the system is a flashlightDoes the autonomous agent work The answer is yes My colleagues Andrew Daley Andrew Girvin Peter Wills and Daniel Yamins and I have simulated the system of diVerential equations that correspond to the dynamics of this autonomousagent molecular reaction network The diVerential equations represent the way the concentration of each chemical species in the autonomous agent changes over time as a function of its own and other chemical concentrations In general in such mathematical models a number of unchanging constants representing kinetic constants and other parameters enter into the diVerential equations In the present case the diVerential equation system has thirteen such parameters The model autonomous agent system is displaced from equilibrium by the persistent addition of the two DNA trimers GGG and CCC the removal of the DNA hexamer and the persistent shining of photons hv from the outside The chemical reaction network occurs under chemostat conditions This means that all molecular constituents of the system are treated mathematically as if they were in a real wellstirred container to which the trimers and photons are added at a constant rate In addition the hexamer molecular components are removed from the system at an adjustable rate that holds their internal concentrations constant whatever the rate of reproduction of hexamer may beThe autonomous agent system reproduces more eYciently with the couplings of the DNA trimerhexamer system to the PP and electron cycles than in the purely exergonic case in which the DNA trimerhexamer system operates alone We measured eYciency thermodynamically as the conversion of available free energy coming into the system from the photon source into the excess hexamer with respect to the undriven steadystate rate of reaction concentration of the hexamerFigure shows the results of our simulations In these simulations of the chemical reaction network there are as noted thirteen kinetic constants We carried out computer selection experiments not only comparing the autonomous agent to a nude exergonic DNA trimerhexamer system but also computationally mutating the kinetic constants by small amounts and computationally evolving autonomous agents to reproduce with higher thermodynamic eYciencyOur results demonstrate first and most important that autonomous agents operating displaced from equilibrium and utilizing a work cycle can be more eYcient at using the available free energy coming into the total system in reproducing hexamer DNA than in the absence of the coupling of the trimerhexamer DNA system to the PP and electronphoton work cycle system Thus the autonomous agent as a whole including its work cycle reproduces DNA hexamer more rapidly than would the trimerhexamer exergonic system alone In short and also important being an autonomous agent coupling an autocatalytic system with a work cycle is of selective advantage compared to being a merely exergonic autocatalytic systemSecond just as in the glycolytic positivefeedback case our autonomous agent model for appropriate values of the kinetic constants can undergo sustained temporal oscillations of PP and other concentrations The oscillation of PP from high concentration to low concentration then back to high concentration during the work cycle is analogous to the expansion and recompression oscillation of the working gas in the Carnot engines work cycleThird a mountainous fitness landscape exists in the mathematical parameter space of the thirteen kinetic constants in which some values of the kinetic constants lead to higher eYciency of reproduction than others Darwins natural selection could in principle operate if there were heritable variation in the kinetic constantsThe main conclusion to draw from our simulation is that autonomous agents coupling one or more autocatalytic and work cycles are a perfectly reasonable if novel form of nonequilibrium open chemical reaction network There is no hocus pocus here In the near future we will almost certainly construct such autonomousagent molecular reaction networks and study their dynamics and evolutionary behavior A general biology is in fact around the cornerThe hypothetical molecular autonomous agent that we have considered has been discussed for simplicity as if the problem of retaining the reactants in a confined region of space could be ignored In fact this assumption is an idealization Were our autonomous agent in a dilute solution the rates of reaction would be very slow Actual creation of a functioning molecular autonomous agent will require that the reacting molecular species be confined to a small volume or a surface or in some other fashionCandidates for isolation to small volumes include micelles and liposomes Both macromolecular aggregated structures are comprised of amphipathic molecules that is molecules with hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions such as lipids Micelles are singlelayered structures which in an aqueous medium have hydrophilic regions directed outward but are able to enclose an aqueous core in which the other molecular species of an autonomous agent might reside In an aqueous medium liposomes form doublelayered membranes homologous to cell membranes with hydrophilic heads in the aqueous medium and hydrophobic tails abutted In an aqueous medium both micelles and liposomes can form and even reproduce by budding A fullfledged molecular autonomous agent would have to synthesize the lipid or similar molecular constituents of its bounding surface and coordinate budding with dispersion of autocatalytic and work cycle partners to daughter vesiclesAn alternative to isolation of the autocatalytic and work cycle molecular species within a bounding volume is the confinement of such reacting species to a surface Such confinement has the further advantage of altering diVusive search by reactants from a three to a twodimensional search process The latter can shift the corresponding chemical equilibrium toward synthesis of larger polymers from their smaller substates Here one can imagine confinement of reactants and products to clay surfaces or confinement of complex organic reactants and products to the surfaces of the abundant dust particles in giant molecular clouds in galaxiesI will have much more to say in subsequent chapters about the properties of molecular autonomous agents In particular in order to understand agents we will have to carry out a critique of the physicists concept of work as in a work cycle for the best understanding of work appears to be that work is the constrained release of energy Yet the very constraints on the release of energy that are essential to the doing of work themselves constitute the analogues of the gears rods connectors and escapements of an ordinary machine Most important it typically takes work itself to construct the constraints on the release of energy that then constitutes work In our first example of an autonomous agent Figure these constraints are present in the invoked couplings of catalysts and allosteric eVectors to the reactions of which the autonomous agent is comprised I have a huncha deep hunch verging on convictionthat the coherent organization of the construction of sets of constraints on the release of energy which constitutes the work by which agents build further constraints on the release of energy that in due course literally build a second copy of the agent itself is a new concept the proper formulation of which will be a proper concept of organizationIn the meantime if I am right what did Schrdinger miss He was right about his microcodethe microcode will reemerge as a subset of the constraints on the release of energy by which an autonomous agent builds a rough copy of itself Namely the microcode is the very structure of DNA which serves as constraints on the enzymes that then transcribe and translate the code But Schrdinger missed stating the requirement for an agent to be nonequilibrium On the other hand displacement from equilibrium is a necessary condition for a microcode to do anything at all So perhaps displacement from equilibrium was implicit in his theme More important I think is that he missed the concept that an agent is a union of an autocatalytic system that does one or more work cycles This union is a new kind of dynamical systemNow that we have seen an autonomous agent I find myself wondering whether autonomous agents may constitute a proper definition of life itself I make no attempt to defend my own strong intuition that the answer is yes I suspect that the concept of an autonomous agent as an autocatalytic system carrying out one or more work cycles defines life If so here is the center the elusive core of life that examination of the molecular chunks of cells does not reveal Most of the remainder of this book is devoted to examining the unexpected unfoldings of this tentative definition of autonomous agents and perhaps life But I certainly will not insist upon my intuition It suYces at this stage to note that all freeliving systems we knowsinglecell bacteria singlecell eukaryotic cells and multicelled organismsfulfill my definition of autonomous agentIf Figure shows us a first case of a molecular autonomous agent how broad a family of systems does the concept of an autonomous agent embrace I confess I do not know Clearly there is nothing in the concept of a reproducing system that carries out at least one thermodynamic work cycle that limits such a system to DNA RNA and proteins As we have seen Julius Rebek has already created selfreproducing organic molecules well outside the familiar classes of biopolymers If no such reproducing molecular system yet enfolds a thermodynamic work cycle that is not to say that we shall long be stalled in creating such systems It seems plausible that wide classes of chemical reaction networks can fulfill the criteria I have traced above But must autonomous agents be molecular in the familiar sense Could mutually gravitating systems such as galaxies fulfill the criteria What of systems made largely of photons selfreproducing spectra in a lasing cavity fed by a gain medium What of geomorphology I do not know Perhaps it suYces at this stage to have begun an enquiry an investigation rather than to have completed itNatural GamesI turn in the final section of this chapter to yet another puzzle concerning what I call a natural game A natural game is a way of making a living in an environment That is autonomous agents are able to act on their own behalf and regularly do so in order to make a living in an environment The bacterium swimming upstream in a glucose gradient is making a living in its environment So in fact are all freeliving entities in the biosphereWell it seems straightforward enough we all know more or less what it is to make a living For example I am currently writing Investigations as part of my own hopefully nottoosolipsistic eVorts to make my own living as a scientistBut natural games are not quite so straightforward I begin by mentioning again the rather surprising nofreelunch theorem proved by Bill Macready and David Wolpert as postdoctoral fellows at the Santa Fe Institute a few years ago Recall that Bill and David were wondering whether there might be some search algorithm for adapting on a fitness landscape that was inherently better than all other algorithms For example John Holland another Santa Fe Institute colleague is justly wellknown for inventing his genetic algorithm to optimize hard computational problems The genetic algorithm which has been rather widely used in academic and industrial settings is based on analogy with biological adaptation driven by mutation recombination and selectionIn eVect Bill and David were wondering whether biological systems in this biosphere happen to have stumbled on the best possible optimization procedure Importantly the answer appears to be no Macready and Wolpert considered a mathematically wellformulated set of all possible fitness landscapes and showed that averaged over all landscapes no search algorithm outperforms any other algorithm No free lunchIn short given an arbitrary fitness landscape only some search algorithms do well on that landscape The search procedure must be tuned to the fitness landscapes being searched if the search procedure is to be more eVective than average among search proceduresBut this poses the important problem raised in chapter Most organisms are sexual hence adapt using both mutation and recombination as part of their search procedures in making natural livings But my own and other research demonstrates that recombination is essentially useless on very rugged fitness landscapes For example Mark Feldman and Aviv Bergman at Stanford have shown that if genes that evolve on rugged landscapes increase the frequency of recombination in model populations of organisms they will not be selected to increase hence establish recombination Yet most organisms are sexual and pay the twofold loss in fitness in requiring two parents rather than one If so presumably our biosphere is rife with the kinds of smooth correlated landscapes for which recombination is a good search procedureThen how is it that in our biosphere we should find a family of landscapes that happen to be well searched by recombination Either such smooth landscapes are built into the physical nature of things or evolution has itself somehow brought forth the very kinds of landscapes that are well searched by mutation and recombination Restated assuming that mutation and recombination are in fact good search procedures for the kinds of fitness landscapes inhabited by we mere mortals as we were hanging around and adaptively hill climbing for the past four billion years I ask again Whence these wonderful fitness landscapes that are so well suited to be climbed by mutation and recombinationLets try another tack Assume for the sake of discussion that I am right about my formulation of molecular autonomous agents When lifeand I argue autonomous agentsbegan their diversity was low There are now some hundred million species representing perhaps a thousandth of the total diversity that has wandered our globe The rest have gone extinct Natural games ways of making a living have obviously coevolved with the autonomous agents the species making those livings So as I imagined Darwin telling us in chapter The winning natural games are the games the winning species playWell of course the winning natural games are the games the winners play But what natural games are these The reasonable answer leaps to mind The winning games must be those that are readily searched out by the very adaptive search procedures used by the coevolving autonomous agents themselvesIn short a biosphere is a selfconsistent coevolutionary construction of autonomous agents and ways of making a living that are themselves selfconsistently well searched by the search procedures the autonomous agents are using In colloquial terms from our experience in economic systems jobs come into existence with jobholders If no one can learn or exploit a given kind of job that sort of job will not be widely populated and will not become diVerentiated into a family of similar jobsIn the biosphere modes of making a living that are wellsearched by mutation and recombination will be populated by many sibling species making their livings by playing slightly diVerent natural games Those natural games therefore proliferate Ways of making a living that cannot be explored successfully by mutation and recombination will not aVord new niches for many sibling species so those natural games will not proliferateWe are literally making our world together we critters If we couldnt make livings at it given our search procedures of mutation recombination and selection we wouldnt be making our livings doing what we are doing These comments are only the start of understanding and I do not profess to hold much of that understanding But I can begin to point A biosphere is a selfconsistent coevolutionary construction of autonomous agents making livings the natural games that constitute those livings and the search mechanisms that allow such modes of living to be persistently mastered by adaptive natural selectionMost broadly I believe a general biology awaits founding And I believe that autonomous agents will prove central to that eVort The next feature of autonomous agents that I will note in closing this chapter will be central to any general biology Precisely because an autonomous agent links exergonic and endergonic reactions in work cycles the breakdown of highenergy sources here can be used to build up structure and organization there Indeed the coevolution of autonomous agents naturally leads to a linked web of exergonic and endergonic reactions within and between the autonomous agents Breakdown of this stuV here is linked to the excess build up of that stuV there By these linkages sunlight spattered carelessly on this swirl of stuV ninetythree million miles from our average star cumulates into the wondrous structure of the giant redwoods tall on the western slopes of the United States and Canada Precisely because autonomous agents carry out work cycles theyweliterally build a biosphereAnd the central factors underlying that buildup of organization are the same factors that apply in an economythat merely human extension of biospheres The central factors in fact center on advantages of trade We can see this keystone concept by supposing that you and I are the only members of a tiny economy You begin life with an endowment of a thousand pears and a hundred apples I begin life with an endowment of a hundred pears and a thousand apples Suppose your happiness or utility would increase if you had fewer rather than more pears and more rather than fewer apples Alas you have more pears than apples I in turn happen to have desires such that I would be happier with rather more pears than apples Alas I have more apples than pearsYou and I have advantages of trade We can both be happier if we swap some of my apples for some of your pears It is essential to understand that indeed both of us can be better oV by trading Advantages of trade are the fundamental factor driving trade itself in an economy In an actual simple economic model advantages of trade are studied in an Edgeworth box Edgeworth invented a twodimensional box representation of values or worths plotted along the edge of his box Figure In the Edgeworth box I am represented at the bottomleft corner you are represented at the topright corner A family of equal happiness or isoutility curves show your isohappiness tradeoVs of apples and pears at any total abundance to you of apples and pears You are in general happier the more total apples and pears you have Your happiness landscape increases from low to high like a coneshaped mountain whose peak is located over my head On that peak you have all the apples and pears in the systemMy isohappiness tradeoV curves begin low at the lowerleft corner and mount to a peak over your head in the upperright corner when I would have all the apples and pearsThe curvature of my isohappiness curves and your isohappiness curves are bent such that they are convex from my and your points of view Therefore if the initial economy starts with you having most of the pears and I most of the apples as shown as a point toward the lowerright of the Edgeworth box in Figure then that initial point of the economy lies on the intersection of a specific isohappiness curve for you and an isohappiness curve for meAnd now we can see advantages of trade Any point that lies inside the region bounded by our two isohappiness curves is therefore higher on your happiness landscape and also higher on my happiness landscape Thus anywhere inside the region bounded by our two isohappiness curves we are both happier We have advantages of trade within this area bounded by our two isohappiness curvesA few more points from Economics Consider the family of your isohappiness curves and the family of my isohappiness curves Pick one of your isohappiness curves There will be exactly one of my isohappiness curves that just touches your isohappiness curve at a single position thus one point of tangency Therefore for each of your isohappiness curves there is a unique point of tangency with one of my isohappiness curves Therefore we can draw a line connecting those points of tangency In particular we can draw a line of those tangencies across the two isohappiness curves yours and mine that meet at the initial applepear distributions to you and me at the outset before trading and define the region where we have advantages of tradeThe line of tangency is called the contract curve Along the contract curve there is no way to exchange apples and pears that increases both our happiness If you are happier I am less happy The contract curve is said to be ParetoeYcient There is no way to make you happier without making me less happy and vice versa In contrast if we have not yet attained the contract curve there are further advantages of trade that we can attain The economic concept of price in this context is just the ratio of exchange between you and me apples for pears Evidently if we attain one of the points on the contract curve that corresponds to some exchange ratio and is the price of apples for pearsNow nothing in a oneshot exchange economy picks any particular point on the contract curve We tussle along the contract curve each trying to get all the advantages of the trade But what if we could take our happiness now call it utility or wealth and reinvest it in making orchards that grew apples and pears In an economy with reinvestment what happens if we can take our advantages of trade and reinvest any excess so that we can create more apples and pears than we had to start withThen let me draw an analogy for bacterial species or other autonomous agents Let happiness or the economists utility become rate of reproduction hence fitness Let increased happiness become increased rate of reproduction hence increased fitness Let the advantages of trade map into mutualistic interactions in which you and I two species of autonomous agents help one another reproduce more rapidly Case in point Legume root systems with microrhizzae and symbiotic fungi in which the root and its plant capture sunlight and water and carbon dioxide and supply sugars to the fungi while the fungi capture nitrogen from the air and fix it into amino acids and supply amino acids to the plant Plant and fungi feed one anotherTwo mutualists A and B can have advantages of trade Molecules created at metabolic cost in A and secreted can help B reproduce faster Molecules created at metabolic cost in B and secreted can help A reproduce faster If the help is larger than the metabolic cost in both directions both win by helping the other Indeed you can quickly intuit that since both A and B will reproduce exponentially there might be a fixed ratio of the abundance of A and abundance of B species such that each helps the other optimally If so then the enhancement in the growth of A and B by their mutual interaction must be the same otherwise either A or B would soon be exponentially more abundant than the other and the mutual help society would fall apartPeter Schuster and Peter Stadler of the University of Vienna and I at the Santa Fe Institute several years ago created a simple model of two replicating RNA species A and B that did help one another in just these ways and it confirmed that in the appropriate mutual help regime the A B mixed community outgrew A alone or B alone Further the growth was such that the ratio of A and B remained fixed Therefore the exchange of As product molecules and Bs product molecules also remained fixed at a specific point on the contract curve That point corresponds to price So in at least some simple models when autonomous agents form a mutualism A and B helping one another they have found a means to create advantages of trade and they can find and remain on a fixed point on the contract curve that establishes an exchange ratiothe priceAnd note with the plant root and the fungi thermodynamic work has been done by the plant to synthesize the sugars from sunlight water and carbon dioxide and thermodynamic work has been done by the fungi to fix nitrogen from the air into amino acids In a real biosphere the linking of exergonic to endergonic reactions by which thermodynamic work is done to build up complex organization is in fact inextricably linked with the emergence of new advantages of tradenew enhanced ways to make livings in new niches In the present case the exchange of sugar and amino acids helps both plant and fungi reproduce more rapidlySo as noted earlier the fact that autonomous agents do link exergonic and endergonic reactions is central to the creation of advantages of trade and hence new niches new mutualistic opportunities They lead to the vast web of an ecosystem trapping sunlight gobbling some water nitrogen carbon dioxide and a few other simple molecular species and literally building up the vast profusion of Darwins tangled bank Ultimately we should be able to build a theory that accounts for the distribution of advantages of trade the distribution of residence times of energy stored in diVerent forms in an ecosystem as well as the statistical patterns of linking of exergonic and endergonic reactions in a biosphere as it builds itself and persistently explores novel ways of making a living the novel niches that permit the success of Darwins minor variations creating novel species for those nichesThe curious thing about evolution is that everyone thinks he understands it Not me Not yet Yet I hope there may be general principles governing the selfconsistent construction of any biosphere In later chapters I will hazard a hunch or two about such general laws but we are only at the beginning of a general biology Chapter Propagating Organizationhis book with its curious title Investigations seeks new questions about the universe It is not always that everything is hidden and science must ferret out the mysteries by scouring for unknown facts although often science proceeds in the manner of finding new facts Rather it can be the case that the world is bluntly in front of us but we lack the questions of the world that would allow us to see There are stories perhaps merely stories of the response to early Spanish ships in the Caribbean by native inhabitants The ships were not seenthere was no concept for themBluntly in front of us The closure of catalytic and work tasks in an autonomous agent by which it genuinely constructs a rough second copy from small building blocks by adroit linking of exergonic and endergonic processes A cell or colony of cells is propagating this organization of processMy aim in the current chapter is to begin to investigate what we might mean and hence see by propagating organization No easy journey this I will begin with Maxwells demon and why measurement of a system only pays in a nonequilibrium setting In a nonequilibrium setting the measurements can be stored and used to extract work from the measured system Maxwells demon is the clearest place in physics where matter energy and information come together Yet we will find the demon and his eorts at measurement tantalizingly incomplete You see only some features of a nonequilibrium system if measured reveal displacements from equilibrium from which work can in principle be extracted Other features even if measured are useless for detecting such energy sources from which work can be extracted Thus whatever the demons eorts there remain the issues of just what features of a nonequilibrium system the demon must measure such that work can be extracted how the demon knows to measure those features rather than other useless features and how once measured couplings come into existence in the universe that actually extract work Not good enough I shall say to assert that in principle work can be extracted How does work come to be extractedA simple example of a device that detects displacements from equilibrium and extracts work is a windmill The vane on the windmill in eect measures the direction of the wind and pivots the windmill such that its fan blades are perpendicular to the wind In turn the wind does work on the blades causing the windmill to rotate The system as a whole measures a deviation from equilibrium here the direction of the wind orients the entire system such that extraction of work by the wind is possible for the device and it actually extracts work The windmill turnsThe universe as a wholefrom galaxies to planetary systems and certainly our and any other biospheresis filled with entities that measure displacements from equilibrium that are sources of energy those entities actually do extract work Think of the teeming busyness of a coevolving mixed microbial community of long ago successfully linking exergonic and endergonic reactions fired by the sun and other highenergy sources That community measured displacements from equilibrium extracted work and inhabited Manhattan three billion years ago literally building highrise microbial mat ecosystems Its microbial descendants are constructing similar highrise structures in the Sea of Cortez and on the Great Barrier Reef of Australia todayWhere did all this come from this measuring of useful displacements from equilibrium from which work can be extracted the devices coupling to such measurements and the extraction of work used to build up new kinds of devices that measure new kinds of displacements from equilibrium to extract work in new ways Yet a biosphere actually constructing itself up from sunlight water and a small diversity of chemical compounds does all this over evolutionary time The biosphere does achieve persistent measuring of displacements from equilibrium from which work can be extracted and does discover devices to couple to those energy sources such that work can be extractedAnd since the biosphere does this and the biosphere is part of the universe then the universe does it This coming into existence of selfconstructing ecosystems must somehow be physics Thus it is important that we have no theories for these issues in current physics The stark fact that a biosphere builds up this astounding complexity and diversity suggests that our current physics is missing something fundamental A biosphere becomes complex the universe becomes complex I will argue that the very diversity and complexity of a biosphere begets its further diversification and complexification I strongly suspect that the same is true of the universe as a whole The universes very diversity and complexity begets its further diversification and complexificationAfter exploring Maxwells demon I will ask a physicists question What is work Physicists have an answerwork is force acting through distancegiven by a single number or scalar representing the sum of the force acting through the distance But it will turn out that in any specific case of work the specific process is organized in some specific way Work is more than force acting through distance it is in fact the constrained release of energy the release of energy into a small number of degrees of freedom It is the constraints themselveswith as Phil Anderson points out a kind of rigiditythat largely constitute the organization of the process Butand here will be the hookin many cases it takes work to construct the constraints themselves So we will come to a terribly important circle work is the constrained release of energy but it often takes work to construct the constraintsA conceptual cluster lies at the heart of the mystery The cluster concerns the progressive emergence of organization in the evolution of the physical universe and of a biosphere That emerging organization concerns the appearance in the evolving universe of entities measuring relevant rather than nonrelevant properties of nonequilibrium systems by which they identify sources of energy that can perform work Then physical entities appear that construct constraints on and couplings to the release of the identified source of energy whereby the energy is actually released and work comes to be performed Such work often comes to be used to construct further detectors of energy sources and entities that harbor constraints on the release of energy which when released constitutes work that constructs still further sources of energy and constraints on its release It should be clear that we have at present no theories about these matters nor even a clear concept of the subject matter of such theoriesThe heart of the mystery concerns a proper understanding of organization and propagating diversifying organization Most profoundly the mystery concerns the historical appearance since the big bang of connected structures of matter energy and processes by which an increasing diversity of kinds of matter sources of energy and types of processes come into existence in a biosphere or in the universe itself This is what lies directly before us but which we have not been able to see A biosphere does all the above Ours has for four billion years of awesome illunderstood creativity Doubt it Open your eyes and look around youThe universe since the big bang was and remains out of equilibrium or vastly nonequilibrium It was a profound insight in the development of equilibrium thermodynamics to recognize that the energy present in the thermal motions of an equilibrium gas system could not be extracted to do work But we might ask a similar question of the nearly featureless profound nonequilibrium of the early universe How in the absence of specific structures and processes could the nonequilibrium universe couple that enormous energy to the specific generation of anything at all Part of the answer lies in the concept of broken symmetries Consider a pole standing vertically on a horizontal plane In due course it will fall over under the influence of gravity Prior to falling its range of possible directions to fall is the full circle After it falls it points in some specific direction By falling the pole has broken the circular symmetry of the system and come to a specific orientation Thus part of the answer to the emergence of specific structures lies in the expansion and cooling of the universe with the associated sequences of symmetry breakings that split the four fundamental forces yielded a quarkgluon soup that cooled into other elementary particles then atoms simple molecules selfgravitating masses galaxies giant molecular clouds and secondgeneration starsAs symmetries broke the variety of matter and process increased As the variety increased the pairwise diversity of matter and processes increased roughly as the square of the diversity Hence it became more probable that specific pairs of spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes might become linked in a variety of ways capturing the energy resources of the spontaneous processes that could then flow in constrained ways into the nonspontaneous processes to yield novel consequences Among those consequences are the construction of new structures able to measure sources of energy Among the other consequences are the generation of novel and specific nonequilibrium energy sources and of structures and constraints that might couple to those novel specific sources of energy The couplings and constraints in turn channel the release of energy in specific ways that constitutes the work that is done to construct still further novel energy sources measuring structures couplings and constraints This in a nutshell is the universe diversifying constructing structures and processes propagating and elaborating wondrous organizationIn chapter I introduced the chemical adjacent possible and will return to it in later chapters In terms of molecular diversity and other types of diversity the universe and the biosphere keep advancing into a persistent adjacent possible New kinds of molecules with new properties themselves and in couplings with other kinds of molecules persistently arise on planet Earth and presumably in the giant cold molecular clouds that are the birthplaces of stars in most spiral galaxies The new species of molecules aord the novel exergonic and endergonic reactions novel constraints and novel sources of energy that are part of the creativity outside our collective windowYet we hardly know how to say what this propagation and elaboration of organization and process is nor have we a clue about whether there may be general laws that govern such selfconstructing nonequilibrium processes Such a law could be my hopedfor fourth law of thermodynamics for open selfconstructing systemsWe have begun with autonomous agents But we are here driven beyond biospheres What are the general conditions that allow such selfconstructing nonequilibrium processes to flourish Are biospheres the only examples What of the evolution of the geology of a planet a solar system a galaxy the universe as a whole Are there ways of thinking about the emergence of structures that measure and discover sources of energy in nonequilibrium systems together with the emergence of structures and processes that couple to sources of energy do work to construct constraints and propagate the constrained release of the discovered energy such that more diverse structures constraints and processes can arise de novo in the adjacent possible of the evolving universeIs the universe highly diverse and is our biosphere diverse because there is some general law or tendency for such nonequilibrium selfconstructing systems to diversify I confess I suspect so In an intuitive nutshell in a nonequilibrium setting the greater the diversity of structures potential reactions or other transformations among structures measurement processes and devices coupling devices and constraints that already exist in a ramified web of propagating structures reactions work measurement constraint and coupling constructions the easier it is for the total system to generate new kinds of molecules or other structures processes measurement devices couplings and constraints such that a biosphere or the universe can expand into the newness of its adjacent possible But those new structures processes measuring devices couplings and constraints in turn increase the total diversity hence enable yet further expansion into the adjacent possible creating perpetual autocatalytic novelty on timescales that must be vastly longer than the current age of the universeThe universe in short is breaking symmetries all the time by generating such novelties creating distinctive molecules or other forms which had never existed before Indeed there may be a general law for biospheres and perhaps even the universe as a whole along the following lines A candidate fourth law As an average trend biospheres and the universe create novelty and diversity as fast as they can manage to do so without destroying the accumulated propagating organization that is the basis and nexus from which further novelty is discovered and incorporated into the propagating organizationAutonomous agents themselves selfreproducing systems carrying out one or more work cycles linking exergonic and endergonic processes in a cyclic fashion that propagate the union of catalysis constraint construction and process organization that constitute such autonomous agents are but the most miraculously diversifying examples of this universal process in our unfolding everchanging universeMaxwells DemonArguably James Clerk Maxwell was the greatest scientist of the nineteenth century notwithstanding giants such as Carnot Boltzmann and Darwin While his most radical work is captured in the Maxwell equations for electromagnetic fields which introduced the fundamental concept of fields into physics Maxwell concerned himself deeply with the puzzle Carnot had raised in what is now called the second law of thermodynamicsConsider again a thermodynamically isolated system That is consider some box containing a gas isolated from any change in its energy or mass arriving from the outside There are N gas particles in the box and as noted earlier we can consider the positions and momenta of all N particles Each position and each momentum can be decomposed into three numbers defining position and motion in the three spatial directions Hence the entire state of the N particles of gas can be defined by N numbers plus a specification of the interior boundaries of the boxAs described above all the possible states of this N system of particles can be divided into very small volumes of states which we will call microstates Again as noted in chapter a macrostate is a collection of microstates In particular the equilibrium macrostate is a collection of microstates having the property that the gas particles are nearly uniformly distributed in the box with a characteristic equilibrium distribution of velocities that Maxwell himself worked out This equilibrium macrostate has the further important properties that vastly many microstates are in the equilibrium macrostate a few macroscopic featurestemperature pressure and volumesuce to specify the equilibrium macrostateIn terms of microstates and macrostates as we saw the second law can be reformulated in its famous statistical mechanics incarnation The second law becomes the statement that at equilibrium the system will flow from any initial macrostate such that it spends most of its time in the equilibrium macrostate This statement of the second law does not preclude the extremely improbable case in which the N particles just happen to flow to one corner of the box Thus the second law is a statistical law in statistical mechanicsBut now Maxwell enters and invents a wee creature later dubbed Maxwells demon I confess that I find the use of the term demon here more than slightly interesting Maxwells demon is almost an autonomous agent While the demon is not defined as I have done you will soon see that he seems to be able to make decisions and to act on the physical world I suspect it is more than a mere coincidence that Maxwell and we seem forced to use this kind of intentional language In fact an odd feature of physics is that experimenters who are outside the system are always busy intentionally setting up experiments and preparing quantum systems in desired states Surely in a full theory the experimenters themselves each an autonomous agent would be part of the theory And if not why not In chapter I return to this theme for it relates to our incapacity to finitely prestate the configuration space of a biosphereMaxwell asks us to consider the very same box with N particles in it But he imagines the box to be divided into two chambers by a wall with a window in it In the window is a flap valve When the flap valve is open gas particles can pass from the left to the right box via the window or from the right to the left box via the windowNow smiles Maxwell suppose the initial state of the gas in the box is in the equilibrium macrostate No macroscopic work can be done by the equilibrium system That was Carnots central point There is plenty of energy in the random motions of the gas particles but there is no means to extract mechanical work from it say to drive a piston Next says Maxwell warming to his point Imagine that my wee friend operates the flap valve such that whenever a fast gas particle approaches the window from inside the left box toward the right box he opens the flap and lets the faster than average hence hotter gas particle through And suppose my demon also operates the flap value to let the slower than average hence cooler gas particles pass from the right to the left box Well soon the left box will be cool and the right box will be hot And now concludes Maxwell with a broad smile we can use the macroscopic temperature dierence between the left and right boxes to extract mechanical work say by driving a pistonThere you have it Maxwell posed a severe question for statistical mechanics and the second law It appeared that the actions of the demon might circumvent the second lawMaxwells demon has set a puzzle that is still not fully resolved An important step in saving the second law was taken by Leo Szilard who also conceived of the nuclear chain reaction one day in London and helped set in motion the development of the atomic bomb and atomic energy Szilard carried out a calculation linking for the first time the concept of entropy and a new concept of information The entropy of a system is a measure of its disorder Recall that we can define the volumes of dierent macrostates by the numbers of microstates each macrostate contains For convenience take the logarithm of the number of microstates in each macrostate In addition each macrostate also has a probability of being occupied by the system Multiply the logarithm of the number of microstates per macrostate by the probability that the system is in that macrostate Now add up all these quantities for all the macrostates The total is the entropy of the systemStatistically of course the entropy of a system either increases over time or is constant At equilibrium it is constant If the system is released from an initially improbable macrostate its initial entropy for the first period of time is low since most macrostates are not occupied However over time it will tend to spread out over all possibilities and the sum of the probabilities of occupancy times macrostate volumes will increase to the equilibrium valueSzilard took a first step in thinking about what Shannon later called information Roughly Szilard realized that when the demon lets a faster or a slower gas particle pass specifically into the left or right box respectively then the total entropy of the system is decreasing a little bit But in turn Szilard estimated the amount of work that must be done by the demon to discriminate that the gas particle is faster or slower than average It turns out that the work that must be done hence the energy utilized equals the work that can later be extracted from the system after the fast and slow particles are separated into the two boxes Since the work done by the demon equals the work that later can be extracted from the system no net work can be extracted from the equilibrium system and the second law is savedThe link to information due to Shannon comes next Shannon was concerned with transmitting signals down wires He brilliantly thought of the minimal signal as a yes or no answer hence representable as the binary or now called a bit Shannon considered the entropy of a source sending a prospective signal as the set of possible messages that might be sent where each message was to be weighted by the probability of actually being sent He thought of receiving a message as reducing the entropy or uncertainty about which message was actually sent given the initial set of possible messages Thus Shannon wound up reinventing the same mathematics that covers entropy Here there is an ensemble of messages and each can be thought of as occupying a volume in a space of possible messages Each message is sent with some probability from the source So Shannon took the logarithm of the volume in message space occupied by a message and multiplied it by the probability that that message was sent from the source If the fraction of the total volume of message space occupied by a given message is p then the logarithm of this volume is logp and the probability of that volume is p Thus the logarithm of a probability of a message multiplied by that probability itself is plogp The sum of these plogp terms for the total set of messages at the source is the entropy of the source Reception of a signal reduces the receivers uncertainty about what is being sent from the source hence is a negative entropy Shannons information measure is thus just the negative of the normal entropy measureThe link established by Szilard between information and Maxwells demon is roughly that the discrimination by the demon that a given gas molecule is faster or slower than average and whether it is coming from the left or right box hence whether he should open or close the flap valve constitutes a measurement that extracts information about the gas system hence lowers the uncertainty about the gas system hence lowers the entropy of the gas systemImportantly there is an implied observer in discussions about entropy Thus a physicist might typically say that the entropy of a system is due to our coarse graining of the system into arbitrarily chosen macrostates If we had more information about the microscopic states of the system our more refined coarse graining would reduce the entropy of the system from our point of view Indeed there has been some genuine confusion about the role of the observer and his more or less arbitrary choice of coarse graining in the concept of entropyOne resolution to this confusion has been suggested by Rolf Sinclair and Wojciech Zurek who have returned to the demon problem with a wonderful set of concepts When the demon has at it with the flap valve he is in fact performing measurements on the gas system As he performs the measurements he knows more about the detailed state of the system Now just what might it mean to know about the gas system One useful sense of know is that the demon has some compact description of the state of the gas system Indeed the compact description of the equilibrium state is about as compact as you can get A few macroscopic variablestemperature pressure volumesuceOne modern sense of a compact description of something is a computer program We are to think of the computer program as a calculating engine We give it initial input data It has some program typically written as a sequence of binary numbers and and the program operates on the input data also a string of binary symbols and churns out an answer Then the concept of a compact description becomes the concept of the shortness of the symbol string giving the input data and the shortness of the program In order to maximize compression we must get all redundancy out of both the input symbol string and the symbol string representing the programSinclair and Zurek have independently carried out work that shows the following Initially as the demon operates his knowledge about the system increases hence the entropy of the gas system decreases But at the same time as the demons information about the system increases the length of the most compact description of the system increases as well In fact the length of the most compact description increases on average exactly as fast as does the decrease in the entropy of the gas systemBut as the length of the most compact description increases bit by actual bit its information content increases bit by bit Thus for each bit in reduction of the entropy of the gas system achieved by our measurements the information content of the most compact description increases on average exactly as rapidly Or as Zurek says in the modern interpretation the sum of the entropy of the gas system plus the observers knowledge about that system is a constant for an equilibrium gas systemWell we could still cheat and extract work from our measured gas system using the information about its microstate achieved by all the measurements But Sinclair notes that in the long run the cheat will not work We have had to record the information about the gas system somewhere say in the registers on a silicon chip At some point in a closed system the chip will be filled up with bits in registers To keep measuring the equilibrium system we will have to erase the chip And Sinclair did the calculation that mirrors Szilards To erase a memorystored bit has a minimal energy cost that exactly balances the work we could get from the gas system by using the stored information about the system The second law again in the statistical sense holds No macroscopic work can be done by an equilibrium system Measurement does not pay in an equilibrium settingWhy this long discourse Because it does pay to measure the gas system if the gas system is not at equilibrium Think of a simple example The gas particles in the left box are actually hotter than the gas particles in the right box Thus pressure in the left box is higher than in the right box If the flap valve is opened gas will tend to flow from the left to the right box until equilibrium is established Note that a very simple compact description has captured these features of the nonequilibrium system and work can be extracted as the gas system flows to equilibriumMore generally Zureks point is that as measurements are performed on a nonequilibrium gas system the length of the most compact description increases more slowly than the knowledge thus gained reduces the entropy of the system It pays to measure the nonequilibrium system in the sense that those measurements specify the displacements from equilibrium that constitute energy sources that can be utilized to extract workSo the demon is indeed a place in physics where matter energy information and indeed work come togetherLets consider just how work might actually be extracted in the classical Maxwell demon situation with an ideal gas in two boxes separated by a partition with the window and flap valve As a simple example consider again the tiny windmill mentioned above consisting of a fan and a vane perpendicular to the fan Let the windmill be located very near the window with the flap valve inside the total gas system If the flap valve is opened a wind will pass transiently from the left to the right box The windmills vane will measure the direction of the wind and actually orient the windmill fan blades perpendicular to the wind The wind will cause the fan to turn thus the turning fan extracts mechanical work from the system until equilibrium is reachedBut now we need to pause and reflect for the story of the demon is both tantalizing and incomplete Consider again our tiny windmill What feature of the total gas system was measured and detected such that work could be extracted Roughly the wind from the left to the right boxBut not all measurements of the twobox system would have resulted in information that was useful in the sense that work could have been extracted by the actual box in its actual configuration For example the box with the flap valve separates the left and right boxes suppose that there is an identical number of gas molecules in the two equalsized boxes and that the gas in the left box is hotter than the gas in the right box Further suppose the demon measures the number and instantaneous locations of all the gas particles in the left and right boxes The fact that the particles in the left box are hotter than those in the right box hence are moving faster than those in the right box would not be revealed by a measurement of the instantaneous numbers and locations of all the gas particles in the left and right boxes To measure faster motion the demon must measure positions at two time moments or some other feature such as the recoil of the boxs walls from the momentum transferred by the hotter versus cooler gas particles in the left and right boxes as they bounce o the wall So just how does the demon decide Figure or come to measure the relevant properties such that an energy source is successfully identified such that work can be extractedWe have in fact no answer as yetBut this is an essential issue Only certain features of a nonequilibrium system will upon measurement reveal a displacement from equilibrium that can actually be used to extract work Other features if measured are useless with respect to revealing a displacement from equilibrium that can be used to extract work by any given specific systemIt is important to stress that we have here a sense of useful outside the context of autonomous agents Useful measurements detect features of displacements from equilibrium that reveal energy sources from which work can be extracted Only some measurements are actually useful in this sense in a biosphere a geosphere or a galaxy These useful measurements participate together with the coming into existence of devices that extract work used to build further measurement and work extraction structures in the gradual buildup of the diversity of structures and processes of a biosphere a geosphere a galaxy or a universe This buildup is part of why the universe is complexI believe that we can ultimately create a statistical theory of the probability of the generation of specific novel processes structures and energy sources propagation of measurements detection of useful sources of energy and couplings of structures and processes to the energy sources to extract work and progressively build up still further new structures energy sources and processesall as a function of the current diversity of structures transformation processes and measuring and coupling entities Such statistical theories should be constructable for example for a giant cold molecular galactic cloud or early prebiotic planet or most fundamentally the expanding universe as a whole We need a theory in which symmetry breaking begets further symmetry breaking in a progressive construction of diversifying structures and processes Chapter with its discussion of the origin of selfreproducing molecular systems as a phase transition to supracritical behavior in catalyzed chemical reaction graphs as a function of molecular diversity and the ratio of reactions to molecular species is a partial prototype for such a statistical theory A further partial prototype is present in chapter with its discussion of autonomous agents as selfreproducing physical systems that do successfully measure displacements from equilibrium and do successfully evolve to couple exergonic and endergonic reactions to achieve completed work cycles The vast and richly coupled network of coupled exergonic and endergonic reactions in the global ecosystem is proof positive of such propagating construction in the physical universe In chapter I will discuss a quantum analogue to such a theory in which complex quantum systems that couple tend to decohere irreversibly to classical behavior and thereby progressively build up complex classical structuresIt is also important to unpack the sense three paragraphs above of actually and any specific system Consider a single gas particle in a box Measure its location left or right of any arbitrary surface transecting the box Here arbitrary means that we can choose to perform any such measurement we wish by placing the partition arbitrarily in the box If we know the particle is to the left of a given arbitrary partition we can in principle extract work by allowing the particle to pass through a window in the partition and do work on a fan as it passes to the right box Hence it seems that in principle any such arbitrary measurement can detect a source of energy that can be used to extract workBut the conclusion is false that any arbitrary measurement of our singlegasmolecule system can detect a displacement from equilibrium from which work can be extracted The in principle just above includes the idea that having made an arbitrary choice of placement of the partition and a measurement of which side of the partition the particle is in and hence having detected by that arbitrary measurement the displacement from equilibrium that is a source of energy we can afterward decide on a construction procedure that will utilize the information about the displacement from equilibrium to extract work from the measured nonequilibrium system In short we can place the windmill in the system after we have measured the location of the gas particle We measure first then place the windmill in the compartment that does not have the particle of gas such that that particle upon passing through the flap valve will cause the windmill to turn slightlyBut what if we already have constructed the system that is to extract the work as in the tiny windmill case and already mounted the windmill at a specific location inside the box Thereafter we perform an arbitrary measurement by placing the partition in the box and then locate the gas particle We may have placed the partition in the box such that the windmill is on the same side of the partition that has the gas molecule rather than placing the partition such that the prepositioned windmill is in the empty side No net work can be extracted The gas molecule will repeatedly bounce o the windmill fan from all angles No net rotation of the fan can occurThus in a concrete context when we can no longer alter the workextracting structure such as the location of the windmill but perform the measurement after the workextracting system is in place then only certain measurements of the nonequilibrium system will detect sources of energy that can couple to the workextracting structure such that work is extracted Other measurements of the extant nonequilibrium system may be utterly useless in the sense that no sources of energy that can couple to the workextracting system are detectedWe see the hints here of something new Only certain features of a given nonequilibrium system if measured will result in detection of sources of energy that might become coupled to specific other processes that by doing work propagate macroscopic changes in the universe Moreover the tiny windmill is an example of a device that not only detects the wind from the left to the right box but also orients the fan perpendicular to that wind and has couplings and constraints embodied in its structure such that mechanical work is actually extractedFine but we built the tiny windmill How do such coupling structures that link identified sources of energy to the carrying out of work come to exist in the universe on their own There is not the slightest doubt for example that such entities have come into existence in our biosphere as autonomous agents have coevolved over the eons Thus a host of new questions are raised In the beginning presumably the universe was simple homogeneous featureless almost isotropic Now it is vastly complex In the beginning the early Earth had a paucity of complex molecules chemical reactions linked structures and processes Now it is vastly complex The universe as a whole has witnessed the coming into existence of novel structures and processes so too has the biosphere Where no dierence existed dierences have come into existence In a general sense the persistent emergence of dierent structures and processes is the persistent breaking of the symmetry of the universe What feeds this apparent propagating diversity One aspect may be the following Consider again the case of the box with the flap valve and something simpler than a fan say a small mica flake suspended in the cooler of the left and right boxes If the flap valve be opened a wind from the hotter to the cooler box is transiently present This is a simple displacement from equilibrium and a simple device the mica flake will be made to quake hence extract mechanical work Now consider an antiferromagnetic material Such material has magnetic dipoles that when adjacent prefer to point in opposite directions The north pole of one prefers to be adjacent to the south poles of its neighbors If arranged along a straight line an antiferromagnetic material has two equivalent lowestenergy ground states NSNSNSNSN versus SNSNSNSNS Now consider a subtle displacement from one of these lowestenergy states say NNNSNSSSN Here rather than alternating N and S poles being next to one another runs of NNN and SSS occur The energy of the total system would be lowered if the dipoles flipped orientation to come closer to one or the other of the ground energy states Therefore at a suciently low temperature such that the system can flow to and remain at a ground state the NNNSNSSSN antiferromagnet is displaced from its lowestenergy equilibrium state and in principle work could be extracted from this system as it relaxes to one of the two lowestenergy states But notice now that compared to detecting the direction of the wind by the mica flake a rather complex and subtle measurement must be made by any measuring device that is to detect the subtle displacement from equilibrium and that any device that is to use that displacement to extract work must be correspondingly subtle Roughly speaking a measuring device must be of similar complexity to the antiferromagnet Indeed a second antiferromagnet could serve as a measuring device if it were near its own ground state and brought into proximity to the first antiferromagnet The runs of SSS and NNN in the first antiferromagnet brought close to a second one with ground state runs of SNS and NSN could cause the first antiferromagnet to flip closer to its ground states Hence the measuringdetectingextracting device must be more structurally and functionally complex than a mere mica flake considered as a thin planar crystalThe linked exergonic and endergonic organic chemistry reactions present in the molecular autonomous agents that we call cells exemplify just this structural and functional subtlety The electric charge distribution on two complex organic molecules brought into proximity coupled with the modes of translational vibrational and rotational motions constitute the subtle means to measure displacements from equilibrium couple to those displacements and achieve linked catalyzed exergonic and endergonic reactions As the molecular diversity of the biosphere increases more such molecular species displaced from equilibrium come into existence more such molecular species able to detect such displacements from equilibrium come into existence more such coupled catalyzed exergonic and endergonic reactions come into existenceIn general it would begin to appear that as a higher diversity of entities come into existenceentities that are then necessarily more complextheir modes of being in nonequilibrium conditions increase in diversity and subtlety In turn the very existence of sets of these increasingly diverse and complex entities gives them an increased number of ways and so an increased probability to couple with one another such that one may measure a displacement from equilibrium of the other hence these entities happen upon a source of energy that can be and is extracted to do work In turn that work may drive nonspontaneous processes to create still more complex molecular species or other entities in the adjacent possibleIn short there appears to be some positive relationship between the diversity and complexity of structures or processes and the diversity and complexity of the features of a nonequilibrium system which can be detected and measured by the detecting structure to identify a source of energy then couple to the source of energy and actually extract work If there is a relation such that diverse and complex features of nonequilibrium systems useful as sources of energy can best be detected by equally diverse and complex structures then there appears to be some generalized autocatalytic set of processes in the universe since the big bang and in a biosphere by which nonequilibrium systems of increasing complexity and diversity arise provide sources of energy of increasing subtlety and complexity and in turn are detected and extracted by the increasingly complex structures that ariseOf course to hint the above is to hint an initial answer At least in our biosphere the cumulative coevolution of autonomous agents has in the past four billion years achieved precisely such a diversification Cells and organisms have achieved astonishingly ramified and subtle detectors that measure sources of energy plus coupling devices that extract work and use it to build rough copies of themselves Thus metabolism in cells is a coupled web of chemical reactions among simple complex and very complex organic molecules ranging from carbon dioxide to proteins comprised of thousands of amino acids The catalytic sites of enzymes possess high stereospecificitythat is shape specificityfor the transition state of the substrates of the reaction Such reactions may release energy or may couple the release of energy to the endergonic synthesis of other molecular species Cells are replete with equally stunning receptor complexes decorating their surfaces Binding a ligand to a receptor may trigger a complicated sequence of reactions leading to the synthesis of hundreds of dierent molecular species But the high specificity of molecular interactions in a cell are precise examples of the coming into existence of richly nuanced structurally and procedurally complex molecular processes that measure and detect sources of energy and couple those sources to the carrying out of further chemical electrical or mechanical workA coevolving biosphere achieves exactly the emergence of such selfconstructing diversifying organization Whether galaxies planetary stellar or other systems do as well is an open question Again one senses the possibility of a statistical theory of the propagation and selfelaboration of such linked structure transformational systemsWorkLets turn to the concept of workI have detailed evidence that work is a puzzling concept I am deeply proud that Phil Anderson one of the worlds best physicists is a close friend One day over an Indian dinner in Santa Fe thinking of the issues above and of more to come I said Phil the concept of work is rather puzzling Phil cracked o a bit of chapati scooped some chutney onto it paused and said YesThank God Im not a physicist so I was glad to get through that hurdleI shall proceed in steps First lets just consider the physicists definition of work as the integral of force acting through distance The physicist has in mind something like Newtons laws where F MA And we understand distance plain old nonrelativistic distance So the work done is given by just adding up little increments of the force acting on a mass and accelerating it through a distanceBut already there is a bit of a puzzle In any specific case of work done some direction of application of force is specified in threedimensional space some actual direction of motion of the mass is specified in threedimensional space and some actual coupling mechanism is in place such that the force does act on the mass and get it to accelerate in that direction How does the specification of a direction come to be How does the organization of the specific case of work come aboutNow in normal physics say collegelevel physics all these specifications occur at the beginning of the problem in the statement of the initial and boundary conditions The billiard balls are in such and such positions on the billiard table the cue is moved with such and such velocity and strikes a given ball in such and such a position with such and such velocity Now given Newtons calculus let us compute the forward trajectory of the balls on the table So the puzzle of where the initial and boundary conditions come from and the specific coupling of cue to ball are hidden in the initial and boundary conditions of the problem and in how Newton taught us to calculate In short the problem of the organization of the process in any specific case of work is hidden from view in the initial and boundary conditions of the usual statement of the physical problem In eect this choice is the choice of the relevant degrees of freedom which is equivalent to the choice of the boundary conditions versus the dynamical variables of the systemBut an evolving biosphere is all about the coming into existence in the universe of the complex diversifying everchanging initial and boundary conditions that constitute coevolving autonomous agents with their changing organization of capacities to measure and detect energy sources and couple those detected energy sources to systems that sometimes extract work We will return in a subsequent chapter to ask if it makes sense to try to finitely prestate the initial and boundary conditions of a biosphere I will claim that it does not I will claim that we cannot finitely prespecify the configuration space of a biosphere hence we cannot finitely prespecify the initial and boundary conditions of a biosphereIf so then we cannot hide the issue of the organization of work processes in a statement of the initial and boundary conditions of the biosphere We must grapple with the emergence and propagation of organization itself on its own terms If so perhaps there is something amiss with the way Newton taught us to do science in his spectacular careerLets take a second look at work Consider an isolated thermodynamic system At equilibrium the system can do no work But let the system be partitioned into two or more domains say by a membrane Ah then one part of the system can do work on the other part For example if the average pressure in one part is higher than in another part the first part can bulge the membrane into the second partWhere did the membrane come from How does the system come to be partitioned Is this just another initial or boundary condition hiding from view the question Where did this organization of stu and process come from Meanwhile note that the concept of work appears to require that the universe be partitioned Regions of the universe must be distinguished by what or whom such that work manages to happenNow I come to a definition I like due to Atkins in his book on the second law Atkins defines work as the constrained release of energy Work is says Atkins a thingThink about the cylinder and piston in the idealized Carnot cycle with the hot compressed working gas in the chamber What are the constraints The cylinder and the piston the position of the piston in the cylinder the grease between the piston and cylinder are constraints These roughly suce together with the hot gas compressed in the cylinder head for work to happen as the hot gas expands and pushes on the pistonWhere did these constraints come from In actual fact in the current case some human or some machine made by a human did work to construct the cylinder the piston assemble the piston into the cylinder with working gas and grease in place Then more work was done to compress and heat the gas by pushing on the piston from the outsideSo we appear to come to an interesting circle It sometimes takes work to construct constraints and it takes constraints to get workDoes it always take work to construct constraints No as we will soon see Does it often take work to construct constraints Yes In those cases the work done to construct constraints is in fact another coupling of spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes But this is just what we are suggesting must occur in autonomous agents In the universe as a whole exploding from the big bang into this vast diversity are many of the constraints on the release of energy that have formed due to a linking of spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes Yes What might this be about Ill say it again The universe is full of sources of energy Nonequilibrium processes and structures of increasing diversity and complexity arise that constitute sources of energy and that measure detect and capture those sources of energy build new structures that constitute constraints on the release of energy and hence drive nonspontaneous processes to create more such diversifying and novel processes structures and energy sourcesI find it delightful that we hardly have the concepts to state these issues surely we have as yet no coherent theory for this burgeoning of process and structure Whatever it is a biosphere does it It was quite barren in Nebraska wherever Nebraska was four billion years ago Not nowPropagating WorkBy way of whimsy consider Figures a and b Figure a exhibits a cannon clearly marked cannon firing a cannonball clearly marked cannonball that hits the ground some distance away creating a hole clearly marked hole In addition to creating the hole the cannonball now embedded in the bottom of the hole has created hot dirt marked hot dirtIn Figure b I exhibit a devicea Rube Goldberg device in factof which I am extremely proud The same cannon as in a now fires the same cannonball which however hits a paddle on a sturdy paddle wheel I constructed Once struck by the cannonball the paddle wheel is set to spinning Prior to my firing the cannonball I contrived to tie one end of a red rope around the axle of the paddle wheel and a modest size bucket to the other end of the rope Thereafter I dropped the bucket down the well The waterfilled bucket has now rested silent and waiting until the cannonball strikes the paddle wheel whereupon the wheel spins the red rope winds up pulling the waterfilled bucket up the well up against the axle which tilts the bucket overyou will have to imagine this partand pours the water into a long funnel that slopes down from the wellhead toward my bean field When the water from the bucket arrives at the bottom of the water pipe it pushes against a flap valve thereby opening the valve and watering my bean field You can see why I might be proud of my machineWhat is the dierence between a and b The point of the cannon and cannonball in the two figures is to emphasize that there is the same total input of energy into the two cases The explosion of gunpowder is evidently the same as is the flight of the cannonball Obviously in Figure a most of the energy carried by the cannonball is dissipated as heat random molecular motions induced in the particles of dirt Indeed I might have sent the cannonball bouncing along a large steel plate rather than hitting mere dirt In the case of the plate no hole would have formed and hot steel would have been the consequenceIn Figure b my Rube Goldberg device achieves a rudimentaryor sophisticated depending upon pride of inventorshippropagation of macroscopic consequences in the universe Note the linking of spontaneous and nonspontaneous processesthe arc of the cannonball imparting energy that winds the wheel and lifts the waterfilled bucket Note also the constraints everywhere present that coordinate the flow of energy into the specific if slightly comical unfolding of eventsIn fact my fine Rube Goldberg device does not quite demonstrate all I might wish it to show for it does not demonstrate the use of the release of energy to actually construct constraints However an ingenious modification of my device of which I am also deeply proud demonstrates constraint construction Let us modify the device such that the cannonball after hitting the paddle wheel and setting it spinning is deflected downward onto the ground and digs a long shallow groove in the dirt with high sides due to the displaced dirt Let this groove lead to the bean field and guide the water spilled from the bucket such that it flows to water the bean field The digging of the groove in the dirt by the cannonball constitutes the construction of constraints on the release of energy for the water flowing down the gravitational potential to the bean field is just such a constrained release of energyMy Rube Goldberg device propagates work it succeeds in creating a sequence of coordinated macroscopic changes in the physical universe I do not know a formal definition of propagating work so in the absence of anything better I will point at what I mean by Figure bWe have some clues in place now Work is the constrained release of energy Often constraints themselves are the consequence of work I have tentatively defined an autonomous agent as a selfreproducing system that carries out at least one work cycle In turn this led us to note that an autonomous agent is necessarily a nonequilibrium device therefore that it stores energy To think about work cycles we have been driven to ask about Maxwells demon measurement when and why measurement pays thence to what features of a nonequilibrium system are measured such that they constitute a source of energy thence to how couplings arise that capture the energy source thence to work and constraints and now to propagating work due to the occurrence of linked sets of constraints and flows of matter and energyA next step is to realize that the only wellknown autonomous agents namely real cells such as yeast bacteria your cells and mine do actually carry out linked processes in which spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes are coupled to build constraints on the release of energy The energy once released constitutes work that propagates to carry out more work building more constraints on the release of energy which when released constitutes work that propagates furtherFigure is a schematic representation of a cell The figure shows a typical bilipid membrane small organic molecules of dierent species A B C D E F G a transmembrane channel and so forth Now in fact your cell typically does thermodynamic work to build up lipids from smaller molecular species Typically the energy is supplied by breakdown of ATP to ADP or similar exergonic reactions in metabolism But lipids have the capacity to fall to a low energy structure which is precisely a bilipid layer As noted in chapter lipids are molecules with a hydrophobic tail and a hydrophilic head The hydrophilic head as the name implies likes water Consequently in an aqueous environment lipids will tend to form bilipid membranes with the hydrophilic heads facing the aqueous medium and the hydrophobic tails buried next to one another away from the water In fact if you take some cholesterol or another lipid or lipidlike molecule and dissolve it in water bilayer membrane vesicles form spontaneously that are called liposomes So your cells do thermodynamic work to make lipids which spontaneously form a lowenergy structure the membraneBut the membrane constitutes constraints Watch A and B are small organic molecular species and are capable of three hypothetical reactions A and B can undergo a two substratetwo product reaction to form C and D A and B can ligate to form a single product E Or A and B can undergo a dierent two substratetwo product reaction to form F and G Naturally each of these three reaction pathways from A and B passes along its own reaction coordinates through its own dierent transition state Because each of the three transition states has a higher energy than does A and B or the products C and D or E or F and G the transition state energy is a potential energy barrier slowing the reaction from A and B down any of the three reaction pathwaysLet A and B dissolve in the bilipid membrane from the aqueous interior of the cell Once this happens immersion of A and B in the membrane environment alters the vibrational rotational and translational motions or degrees of freedom of A and B But in turn these alterations in the motions of A and B alter the heights of the transition state energies along each of the three reaction pathways from A and B to C and D or to E or to F and GBut the alteration in potential energy heights along the three dierent reaction pathways from A and B is precisely the alteration of the constraints on these reactions The barrier heights together with the even higher energy barriers that provide the walls of the reaction coordinates along which the reaction proceeds constitute the constraints So in fact the cell has actually done thermodynamic work to construct constraints on the release of chemical energy stored in A and B that might be released to form C and D or E or F and GMoreover the cell does thermodynamic work utilizing ATP degradation to ADP to link amino acids together into a protein enzyme The enzyme diuses to the AandBladen region of the membrane and binds stereospecifically to the transition state leading from A and B to the products C and D By binding the transition state complex of this reaction pathway the enzyme lowers the potential barrier for the A B C D reaction and the chemical energy stored in A B is released to form C DThus the cell does work both to construct constraints and to modify those constraints by raising or lowering potential barriers such that chemical energy is released More the released energy can and often does propagate to do work constructing more constraints Thus the product D may itself diuse to a transmembrane channel and bind to the channel giving up some energy stored in its structure by an internal rotation to a lower energy state and thereby both bind the channel and add energy to the channel to open the channel such that calcium ions can enter the cell A spontaneous and a nonspontaneous process are coupled Work propagates in cells and often does so by the construction of constraints on the release of energy which when released constitutes work that propagates to construct more constraints on the release of energyRecordsLets turn to the concept of a record As we saw Zurek has led us to the point in thinking about Maxwells demon at which a record of measurements might be kept and used later to extract work In the case of a nonequilibrium system in principle measurements of a system might pay in the sense that more work could be extracted from the systemwhich now becomes a provider of energythan need be used to record and later erase the measurementInterestingly the erasure cost suggests that autonomous agents must be finitely displaced from equilibrium to aord the finite erasure cost and still reproduce In addition of course rapid reproduction requires finite displacement from equilibriumWe have many colloquial notions of a record I want to try a tentative technical definition Records are correlated macroscopic states that identify sources of energy that can be tapped to extract workThus we are to think of records as recording measurements that identify the sources of energy in the measured system which may then be tapped to do work My example of the wind through the window in Maxwells twochambered gas system is a case in point We have good grounds from Zureks work to believe that the complexity of the record is related to the reduction in entropy of the measured systemNotice some interesting features of records First a useless feature of a nonequilibrium system with respect to extraction of work may be recorded Second errors may be made in the record of a useful feature of a nonequilibrium system from which work can be extracted Third the record may go out of date so that work can no longer be extracted by reference to the record Fourth the record may be erased and may be updated All the above features arise in a coevolving microbial community Indeed all sorts of signaling pathways in cells record and report energy sources and coordinate cellular activities within and between cells in a community Mutation recombination and selection are means to update the recording devices with respect to changing sources of energy opportunity and danger Again we see that cells in a community have the embodied knowhow to get on with making a livingWe are struggling with a circle of concepts involving work constraint constraint construction propagating work measurements couplings energy records matter processes events information and organization It has been said by many that we do not understand the linking of matter energy and information The circle above points at something we must trouble ourselves to understand and I suspect that the triad of matter energy and information is insucient Rather the missing something concerns organization While we have it seems adequate concepts of matter energy entropy and information we lack a coherent concept of organization its emergence and selfconstructing propagation and selfelaborationIf we do not yet understand organization fully we can at least think about what happens in autonomous agents such as real cells A real cell a real molecular autonomous agent does in fact carry out selfreproduction In addition it carries out one or more real work cycles linking spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes It does in fact measure detect and record sources of energy and does do work to construct constraints on the release of energy which when released in the constrained way propagates to do more work often constructing further constraints on the release of energy or doing work by driving further nonspontaneous processes Cells do achieve propagating workThe work propagating in a cell achieves a closure in a set of propagating work tasks such that the cell literally constructs a rough copy of itself In a later chapter I will return to discussing tasks which turn out on a Darwinian analysis to be a subset of the causal consequences of the release of energy at a point and time in the system For the moment I want to focus on the concept of a closure in a set of propagating work tasksWe know what it means to cook dinner eat dinner and clean up afterward A coordinated set of activities is carried out that completes the events concerning preparing eating and cleaning up after dinner The notion of completing a set of tasks is not mystical So we can straightforwardly state that a cell completes a set of propagating work tasks such that it builds a copy of itself by linking spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes in constrained waysThus a molecular autonomous agent achieves two dierent closures First it achieves a catalytic closure all the reactions that must be catalyzed are catalyzed by molecular members of the system Second it achieves a closure in a set of propagating work tasks by which it completes the construction of a rough copy of itself Cells achieve this worktask closure nor is there anything nonobjective about this truthNotice that the closure in catalytic and work tasks cannot be defined locally No single reaction no single linking of spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes typically suces to specify the closures we are describing These closures are typically collective properties of the entire autonomous agent in its environment In fact cells achieve closure in some wider range of tasks by which they propagate their organization Thus cells carry out measurements and record them all the time The bacterium swimming upstream in a glucose gradient was my initial candidate example of an autonomous agent The bacterium does so by molecular sensors that measure glucose a molecular motor with a stator and a rotor that can rotate in either direction and a flagellum that can rotate in two directions causing swimming in one direction and tumbling in the other The cell achieves swimming upstream by continuing to swim if the glucose concentration is rising and tumbling then swimming in a random direction if notAutonomous agents achieve catalytic and propagating worktask closures by which they build copies of themselves The myriad sensors receptors ligands enzymes and linked reactions of metabolism are the structure and dynamic of the reproducing cellular autonomous agent that constitutes the measurement detection recording and search for useful energy sources to link into its ongoing construction of itself The propagating closure of events and organization that is a cell or colony of cells an autonomous agent or a collection of autonomous agents is not matter alone energy alone entropy alone nor the negation of entropy Shannons information alone The propagating closure that is an autonomous agent appears to be a new physical concept that we have not known how to see beforeWhat we can here see is the natural embodiment of organization We have I suggest no coherent concept of organization We have tended to think that the concept of entropy of order and disorder in statistical arrangements of states of aairs is the proper and central concept of organization But I claim that entropy is not yet adequate Nowhere does entropy cover the topics we have discussed the closure of catalysis and propagating work tasks creating the complete whole that is an autonomous agent coevolving in a biosphere This closure of tasks measurements records and linkages that propagates macroscopic work seems to constitute at least an ostensive definition a definition by example of organizationAlthough my discussion above about organization is still preliminary the basic points seem correct A coevolving mixed microbial community that existed some three billion years ago diversifying and coevolving via Darwinian mutation recombination and natural selection did in fact measure and detect and create an increasing variety of energy sources did in fact couple those detected energy sources into work cycles and other activities and did in fact build a biosphere Selfconstructing organization did and does propagate Our globe is covered by this propagating organizationlife and its consequencesIndeed it seems important to wonder which conditions in a nonequilibrium universe would allow such propagating organization to proliferate A biosphere does it of course One can imagine a watery planet with small sail boats sails and tillers trimmed to tack forever on a left tack forever circling the everywhere ocean Here the sails and tiller match the windmill and its vane orienting the fan to capture the transient wind and extract mechanical work Intuitively it seems unlikely that such a planet of nonliving complex entities could have arisen spontaneously since the big bang Just as intuitively all we have discussed seems sucient for the ongoing diversification of propagating organization the Darwinian processes of natural selection and random variation the coevolutionary construction of vastly complex autonomousagent cell systems that continually evolve evernovel measurements of novel sources of energy recordings of those energy sources couplings to those sources constraint construction and the linking of exergonic and endergonic reactions that builds the diversifying biosphereThe biosphere is the most rambunctiously complex integrated diversifying milling buzzing busyness in the universe that we know Perhaps there are other biospheres and they too hum in persistent diversification Autonomous agents appear to be a sucient condition for application of this concept of organization and a biosphere comprised of coevolving autonomous agents appears to be a sucient condition for propagating selfconstructing organization It remains an open question whether other structures and processes in the universe that may not be autonomous agentssay lifeless galaxies stars the giant molecular clouds in galaxies or lifeless planetscan generate and propagate diversifying organization as radically well as do biospheresI close this chapter by asking whether there is a way to mathematize the concept of an autonomous agent and through it the concept of propagating organization The answer is perhaps category theory I am honored to note in memorium that my friend and colleague Robert Rosen first explored some of these issues and some others of those touched upon here in his book Life ItselfCategory theory is a branch of mathematics concerning mappings Consider a domain and a range A mapping takes points in the domain to points in the range The mappings might be or many or many For example in a mapping each point in the domain maps to a single corresponding point in the range The domain and range can be discrete sets or continuousAn interesting feature of categories is that a category can have the property that the mapping from the domain to the range is specified by the category itself in a recursive way the elements of the range determine the mapping from the domain to the range This recursive specification comes close to an autocatalytic set We need merely think of a set of molecular species in the domain and a set of molecular species in the range the mapping from domain to range is just the set of reactions that transform the initial substrate molecules in the domain to the product molecules in the range Now an autocatalytic set has the property that certain product molecules in the range namely the products that are also catalysts choose the reactions that are catalyzed from the substrates to the products hence choose the specific mapping from the domain to the range Thus an autocatalytic set can be thought of as this kind of recursive categoryThe category theory image is at least a start with respect to catalytic closure Perhaps some enhanced category theory that includes closures of work tasks measurements and records as well as catalysis is part of what an adequate formalization of autonomous agent may be It is too early to sayOn the other hand I am not persuaded that category theory will suce In category theory it seems necessary to specify ahead of time all the possible domains and ranges and mappings under consideration I will suggest in a later chapter when we consider the evolution of novelties that there is no finite prespecification for the work tasks measurements records and catalytic tasks that might constitute autonomous agents In short I will argue that we cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere Whether an incapacity to prestate the configuration space of a biosphere genuinely precludes the use of category theory to mathematize the concepts of autonomous agents and propagating organization is an open questionWe have arrived at this An autonomous agent or a collection of them in an environment is a nonequilibrium system that propagates some new union of matter energy constraint construction measurement record information and work It is a new organization of process and events The collective behaviors of coevolving autonomous agents have over the past four billion years constructed a biosphere If life is common the elaboration of biospheres in the universe is rife The propagating union of work cum record cum measurement cum constraint construction the propagation of organization unfolding and diversifying exhibits the very creativity of the universe We are entitled to ask whether there may be general laws governing such nonequilibrium selfconstructive processes in biospheres and the universe as a whole I return to candidate general laws in chapters and Chapter A Physics of Semanticsach of the chapters of Investigations broaches new territory Each is tentative and incomplete pointing but not fully adequate Yet I persistently hope it is better to light one candle againstwhat the darkness the veil beyond which we have had no framework of questions before There are grounds reasoned about by the best of philosophers and scientists of the past several centuries to doubt a physics of semantics We are on shaky ground Yet when the first hard frost comes when the birches have been swung their crimson leaves scattered carelessly when crystals splint shallow ponds and old egrets stand dark watch the coming dawn longlegged knowing how winter is thin when the first phase transition of water to ice forms slight solidity across meadow streams small creatures of flesh and concept tiptoe gingerly to some far side where perhaps something new is to be foundWe have lacked a physical definition of an autonomous agent able to manipulate the universe on its own behalfthe egret whose foreboding of winter leads to lifted wing and steady powerful flight The egret is as much a part of physical reality as the atom and perhaps more than the vaunted quark But autonomous agents we who do daily manipulate the world on our own behalf we to whom intentionality and purpose are so inevitably attributed by our common languages we are by my definition of autonomous agents also nothing but physical systems with a peculiar organization of processes and properties If the concept of autonomous agents were something like a usefulor more a properdefinition of life itself then autonomous agents span the gap from the merely physical to that new realm of the merely physical where purpose is ascribed by all of us to one anotherSemantics enters with purpose For this to be true it is not necessary that the carriers of purpose say the same bacterium heading upstream in the glucose gradient be consciousI hope my definition of an autonomous agent is useful an autocatalytic system carrying out a work cycle now rather broadened by the realization that autonomous agents also do often detect and measure and record displacements of external systems from equilibrium that can be used to extract work then do extract work propagating work and constraint construction from their environmentKnowhowBring ourselves empathetically and objectively back three billion years to the mixed microbial community flourishing right about where most of us are now plus or minus a modicum of layers of surface crustal materialI want to say that the autonomous agents comprising that community had individually and collectively the embodied knowhow to get on with making a living in the natural games that constituted their world Indeed as I have emphasized before a biosphere is a selfconsistent coconstruction of autonomous agents ways of making a living and the search procedures mutation recombination as well as behavioral search open to autonomous agents Those means of making a living that were well searched out and mastered by the agents and their search procedures became the kinds of jobs that were widely filled the abundant niches of the biosphere There is in this whole selfconstructing system a wider knowhow beyond the knowhow of any single autonomous agent spinning eagerly in its microenvironment Yet clearly the knowhow is distributed There is no autonomous agent no one who knows how the whole system works any more than anyone at present knows how the global economic system works in its myriad interactions deals steals hopes and frustrationsWhat in the world is knowhow Philosophers distinguish between knowhow and know that I know how to tie my shoes and am learning how to play jazz drums Know that concerns propositions most conveniently human propositions I know that the moon isthey tell menot made of green cheese I know that the earth circles the sun that the earth is roughly spherical that chairs are used to sit on Know that brings with it the standard and nonstandard issues of the truth or falseness of propositions as they report states of the world Perhaps higher primates who are trained to manipulate simple symbols with apparent reference to the world also can know that with respect to propositionsUnlike know that knowhow does not involve propositions about the world Knowhow involves procedural knowledge about how to get on in the world The cheetah streaking after the wildebeest the athletic genius high jumping have the knowhow to do itDoes a bacterium know how to make a living in its world I certainly want to say yes without attributing consciousness in any way Watch the myriad subtle turnings on and o of genes metabolic switching mechanical twitching sensing of glucose gradient swimming and tumbling upstream to higher glucose concentrations It knows how all right even if it cannot talk about how it gets on with its business But then try to talk about tying your shoes or the skilled driving when you become aware some dozens of miles down the road that you have accomplished the tasks without paying the slightest focused attentionThank God for knowhow Know that is a thin veneer on a fourbillionyearold knowhow skill abundant in the biosphere But any autonomous agent proliferating alone or in a congery of other agents it would seem is also graced by the selfsame knowhow If we synthesize autonomous agents in the next decades and they coevolve under our rapt gaze over months or years into a modestly complex ecosystem brimming with novel life forms they too will know how to make a living in their mutually created world plus the boundary conditions we more or less intelligently impose on themThe knowhow is in these terms nothing but another view of the propagating closures of catalysis work tasks sensing recording and acting that we now recognize as inherent in the doings of autonomous agents The knowhow is not outside that propagating organization The knowhow is the propagating organizationSemanticsAll of which brings us inevitably to the brink of semanticsIt is simple at its roots you see An incoming molecular species arriving in the interior of an autonomous agent really is i food ii poison iii a signal iv neutral v something else Once there is an autonomous agent there is a semantics from its privileged point of view The incoming molecule is yuck or yum I think the major conceptual step to yuck or yum is unavoidable once there is an autonomous agent And I think we have roughly the Darwinian criteria in mind If yum then there will probably be more of this type of agent osprings of the first If yuck it is not so likely this lineage will prosperOnce yuck and yum we are not far from C S Pierces meaningladen semiotic triad sign signified significans Like it or not the glucose gradient is a sign a predictor of more glucose that way Granted the glucose is not an arbitrary symbol any more than a cloud is an arbitrary symbol of rain In this restricted sense signs are causally correlated with that which is signified By contrast the relation between the word chair and that which it signifies and on which I am now sitting is arbitrary But can chemical signals in bacterial and plant and human communities be arbitrary from a chemical causal point of view If so can mere chemicals be signs in the full Piercean senseI believe it is clear that mere chemistry in an autonomous agent can harbor symbols and signs in the full senses of the words Consider first the famous genetic code Triplets of nucleotides in an RNA molecule stand for specific amino acids that will end up incorporated into a protein The detailed causal machinery involves transfer RNA molecules with their anticodon site and the distant site to which amino acids are attached the aminoacyle transferase enzymes that charge the amino acid binding site of each transfer RNA with the proper amino acid among the twenty amino acids the binding of the charged transfer RNAs anticodon site to the proper RNA code word triplet the ribosome that glides between adjacent charged transfer RNA molecules and links the successive amino acids into the growing polypeptide chain that hangs free in the cytoplasm tethered by the ribosome to the messenger RNA molecule as it is translatedThe arbitrariness of the genetic code is exemplified by the evolution of novel transfer RNA molecules which translate a given messenger RNA code word triplet into a dierent amino acid As J Monod properly emphasized three decades ago in a slightly dierent context concerning activation and inhibition of enzymes at allosteric sites on the enzyme that are distant from the catalytic site the relation of chemical structures that achieve control of catalysis are utterly arbitrary with respect to the chemical structures that undergo the catalysis The same is true of the transfer RNA where the anticodon site is distant from the amino acid binding site Because of this which amino acid is charged onto a particular transfer RNA is utterly arbitrary and controlled by the aminoacyle transferase enzyme that does the charging plus the structure of the amino acid binding site on the transfer RNA Both of these can be altered without altering the anticodoncodon matching mechanism In short chemistry allows arbitrary organizations of control relationsIt seems fully legitimate to assign the concepts of sign signified and significans to the genetic code It seems legitimate to extend that notion to much of the subtle signaling chemical and otherwise within and between autonomous agents as exemplified by plants that upon infestation by a particular insect secrete a secondary metabolite chemical that warns other members of the same species that an insect infestation is happening and to turn on defensive antiinsect secondary metabolitesThe calculus that is Claude Shannons elegant information theory has always been about reduction of uncertainty about the statistics of the source of a set of symbols Nowhere in the core of Shannons work concerning the encoding and transmission of information does the meaning or semantics of the information enter This is no criticism and is widely known and appreciated There is however just a hint of semantics in Shannons view that the semantics resides in the decoderI cannot buy Shannons view unless the decoder is an autonomous agent If not then the decoder merely transforms a bit string sent along a communication channel into some other discrete or continuous dynamicsperhaps a set of waterfilled bowls is drained by turning on a machine that opens valves between the bowls and to the outside world in particular ways The patterns of bowl drainage upon receipt of the binary string messages sent along the communication channel constitutes the decodingBut if the recipient is an autonomous agent such as a bacterium and the incoming molecule is a symbolsign of a paramecium or an amoeba on the roam and the bacterium swims away and avoids becoming dinner that sequence of events seems laden with semantics If only the bacterium could tell us Did you see that truck of a paramecium coming at me Ive run into that one before I ducked under a boulder and he never sensed me I made it home Pass me some more glucose please MarthaI will return in the next chapter to discuss such stories for I will say that we cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and therefore cannot deduce that which will unfold Thus among other things we must tell stories to understand the oriented actions of agents in their worlds Do not be overly quick to accuse me of anthropomorphizing I too know the risks including the common claim that we can always in principle translate from intentional talk to the fully predictive causal account of the events in question But patience Not only are we unable to prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and predict what will unfold but we also cannot even translatein the sense of necessary and sucient conditionsfrom legal talk to normal intentional talk let alone from legal talk of Henderson found guilty of murder to a physical talk about soundwave forms monitored and masses at spacetime lines as a descriptionThen lets just be naive for the moment The semantics of the yuck or yum coming into a simple autonomous agentsay an early bacteriumis somehow linked with the embodied knowhow of that agent in making a living or failing to make a living in its world The semantics of an event is some subset of the fully embroidered contextdependent set of causal implications of the event or signal in questionFor want of a nail the shoe was lost for want of the shoe the horse was lost and for want of the horse the rider was lost more or less said Benjamin Franklin The semantics of the nail is some subset of this embroidered contextdependent set of implications of the event or signal in question to the autonomous agents in the coevolving systemIt seems hard to ascribe purpose in the sense of acting on its own behalf to a stone or a chair and easy with respect to an alga Of course there is a sense in which my attribution of semantics to autonomous agents is purely tautological After all I began by stating that a bacterium swimming upstream in the glucose gradient was acting on its own behalf in an environment defined an autonomous agent as a physical system able to act on its own behalf then asked what a physical system must be such that it can act on its own behalf Now five chapters later it is hardly an independent deduction that autonomous agents are the proposed organization of matter energy and organization to which purposes can be ascribed in the sense of being able to act on their own behalf My definition is a definitional circleOn the other hand while the definition is circular like F MA and Darwins natural selection and fitness that does not mean that the set of codefined concepts surrounding my definition of an autonomous agent as a reproducing system that does a work cycle fails to touch the real world Stones and chairs are not by my definition autonomous agents All living cells are And the stunning fact directly before us every day is that autonomous agents do manipulate the world on their own behalf Watch a pair of nesting birds build their nestIn short once we have autonomous agents and yuck and yum it appears that semantics enters the universe as the agents coevolve and behave on their own behalf with one another in the unfolding of a biosphereKnowingWhat about knowingDaniel Dennett in his fine book Darwins Dangerous Idea advances a hierarchy of forms of knowing if I may use that term that have arisen in evolution by Darwinian means I find his hierarchy congenial and informative Dennett envisions evolution as a sequence of kinds of construction cranes that bit by bit build up higherorder entities via variation and natural selectionI do not disagree although I have placed far greater emphasis on the roles of selforganization in evolution Here in Investigations I am trying to point at the mysterious but utterly natural hopefulness in which an increasing diversity of broken symmetries in the universe creates the diversity of structures and processes that can constitute and identify ramified and ramifying sources of energy detect those sources of energy create devices and processes that couple to those sources of energy and generate yet more diversity that propagates macroscopic order even further I wonder in short at the naturalness and selfgeneraticity of Dennetts cranes building cranes building cranes in biospheres perhaps planetary geologies and beyondBut back to the past Dennett distinguishes Darwinian creatures Pavlovian creatures Popperian creatures and Gregorian creatures A simple autonomous agent say a bacterium is a Darwinian creature In its simplest version the creature evolves by mutation also recombination and natural selection For the moment no behavioral learning is to be considered So one or a colony or an ecosystem of Darwinian creatures adapts more or less as Darwin told usAt the next level up say aplysia a nervous system is present and the creature is capable of stimulusresponse learning la Pavlov Indeed aplysia can learn very simple conditioned stimulithe later analogue is the bell causing the dog to salivate in expectation of foodAt the next level Dennett perhaps properly reserves this for us vertebrates is the Popperian creature Popperian creatures in Dennetts fine phrase have internal models of their world and can run the internal model with the clutch disengaged rather than running the model in real time in the real world This allows us lucky Popperian creatures to allow our hypotheses to die in our stead I love that imageBeyond the Popperian is the Gregorian creaturenamely at least humans Dennett makes the wonderful argument that we utilize our toolsliterally stone knives arrows digging sticks machine toolsto enlarge our shared world of facts and processes This enlarged shared world gives us more knowhow and more know that Cultural evolution at some point begins to burst outofbounds Hard rock music jangles the minarets of Iran Who knows what new cultural forms will blossom Chinese cooking lands in Cuba and CubanChinese cuisine is invented Whats next under the sun Who can sayI very much like Dennetts ladder of knowhow and eventual know that Without invoking consciousness not because it is not worth invoking but because so little sensible has ever been said on the subject it seems worth asking how much of this hierarchy could be realized by simple molecular systems even without evoking nerve cellsI would think a lot of this hierarchy could find molecular realizations For example bacteria and amoebae do have a kind of Pavlovian learning already for they have receptors that accommodate to a constant level of a given signal ligand and sense instead a change from the current level This is not yet the association of a more or less arbitrary conditioned stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus but I can imagine chemistry to accomplish the latter As neurons are supposed to proliferate and form novel synaptic connections that survive if used and to mediate the linkage of conditioned to unconditioned stimulus why not envision a complex chemistry say very complex carbohydratesynthesis patterns sustained by complex sets of enzymes whose activities are modulated by the dierent carbohydrates themselves which is true of contemporary carbohydrate metabolism Such a system might blindly try out variant patterns of synthesis until it could establish a selfsustaining web linking the carbohydrates the enzymes and certain protein receptors mediating the linkage between unconditioned and conditioned stimulus then maintain that linkage by positive feedback loops The image is not too far from how it is imagined that idiotype and antiidiotype immune networks work to sustain synthesis of a set of desired antibodies against an incoming pathogen In such networks for which there is modestly good evidence a given first antibody serves as an antigen that stimulates the body to produce a second antibody that binds to the unique amino acid sequences called the idiotype of the first antibody In turn the second antiidiotype antibody stimulates a third which stimulates a fourth But this series is likely to form feedback loops because the first and third antibody can often both bind to the same site on the second antibody hence the first and third antibodies are similar shapes in shape space It is not much of a stretch to think of the immune system as a conditioned stimulus response systemPopperian creatures Why cannot the molecularsensing and hypothesistesting churning concerns of the bacterium as it senses a paramecium churn twenty cycles before kicking in the rotary motor or not such that the wee bacterium hides under a boulder of a grain of sand until the beast passes by Are nerves necessary Plants as noted are said to signal one another with complex secondary metabolites to characterize the particular kinds of insects infesting the glade There are arbitrary structural relations between the metabolite and the insect just as symbols in human language are often arbitrary with respect to the signified Not bad for nerveless nonvertebratesI do get stuck at Gregorian creatures Even here the free and open creating of new symbol strings in a language wherever new sentences can be created is not that fundamentally dierent from the persistent open creation of new kinds of molecules in the biosphere as a whole If the conversation we recent twolegged ones are having with respect to our digging sticks and atomic bombs is impressive so too is the chemical conversation in any fullfledged ecosystem where we are all instrumental in the lives of one anotherI suppose I am naively driven to consider that the biosphere with its urgent diversity in which emboldened by all our knowhow we do get on with a very rich conversation may very early already have harbored all the levels of which Dennett speaks We humans are just more gregarious with our vocal cords and email I guess Smart place a biosphere lots to talk about Four billion years of yammering Slapstick comedy may have started a long time agoEthicsAnd what of ethics Does a whi of ethical issue arise with autonomous agents Yuck or yum from my point of view if I am an autonomous agent There are deep reasons for caution Hume told us long ago about the naturalistic fallacy One cannot deduce ought from is From the fact that mothers care for their young we cannot deduce that they ought to do so Hume argued From the fact that Hitler set out to conquer Europe and more and to kill Jewry we cannot deduce that he ought to have done soIndeed Humes injunction underlies the caution of scientists about making ethical statements We scientists find the facts You citizens across the globe can argue the ethics But if Hume warns us not to deduce ought from is where do values come from at all Humes injunction against deduction from is to ought nevertheless began by recognizing the legitimacy of the category oughtThe eorts following Hume to understand the meaning of ethical assertions have been long twisted arduous Following the dictates of the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle that only those statements capable of verification were meaningful philosophers as famous as G E Moore came to wonder if ethical assertions were merely emotive utterances It is wrong to kill Becomes Agggah Does the positivist argument seem persuasive It has always amused me that the core injunction of the logical positivists only those statements that are empirically verifiable are meaningful is itself not empirically verifiable One is reminded of something about hoisting and petards John Rawls of Harvard has argued eloquently that our human notions of fairness derive from what we would all contractually agree to were we to know before birth that we would all be born with diering abilities and endowments Thus equality before the law is one contract that Rawls commends to us Equality before the law is far more refined than the yuck or yum of the bacterium The emergence of ethics in the evolution of life on this planet is a fascinating issueI will content myself with wondering where value and the rudiments of intentionality come from in the physical universe in the first place and leave social contracts for other eorts Where is the place of value in a world of fact So a short soliloquy Facts are knowthat statements But knowhow preceded know that While fully aware of Humes injunction I think that from the autonomous agents perspective yuck or yum is primary unavoidable and of the deepest importance to that agent I suppose we apply the Darwinian criteria Too much yuck this one and its progeny are gone from the future of the biosphere Without attributing consciousness to an E coli or an autonomous agent we may create in the near future I cannot help but feel that the rudiments of value are present once autonomous agents are aroundAnd again without attributing consciousness once an autonomous agent is around is the rudiment of intentionality present If so another cornerstone of ethical activity has been laid Ethical behavior requires first the logical possibility of behavior for which one is responsible You are not responsible for acts and eects beyond your control To act ethically you must first be able to act at allBut what are acts in the first place Daniel Yamins is a brilliant young mathematician Now entering Harvard Dan spent a summer with me at the Santa Fe Institute before he learned to drive after an earlier summer spent in the laboratory of Jack Szostak at Harvard where at age fourteen Dan was learning to evolve RNA molecules to bind arbitrary ligands Dan and I struggled that summer to make the distinction between the doings of an autonomous agent and mere happenings in and around the autonomous agent Note we say the E coli is swimming upstream in the glucose gradient to get dinner But all sorts of molecular vibrational rotational and translational motions are occurring What are actions and what are mere happeningsI do not think we were successful in drawing a clean distinction between doings and happenings with clear mathematics But I sense that the distinction between doings and happenings Dans happy phrasing is relevant for E coli tigers us trees and autonomous agents in general We will meet a similar problem in the next chapter when we attempt to distinguish between the function of a part of an organism and the other causal consequences of that part of the organismStrange and interesting is it not that these issues all seem to arise with autonomous agents but not otherwise Granted that we here seem to confront the language game circularity alluded to earlier yet I do truly think that the rudiments of semantics intentionality value and ethics arise with autonomous agents I do not think those rudiments suce to jump over Humes naturalistic fallacy We cannot deduce ought from is in any concrete context but I think we have the categories of ought and is in the physical universe once we have autonomous agents Chapter Emergence and StoryBeyond Newton Einstein and BohrHow brazen a chapter subtitle Beyond Newton Einstein and Bohr Yet hints we shall find for the science of Newton Einstein and Bohr remains innocent of the propagating coconstructing organization of autonomous agents of nonequilibrium systems building a biosphere Yet surely the biosphere is part of the universe and any general laws of the universe must necessarily encompass biospheres here and if a general biology is necessary elsewhere in the vastness we glimpseAnd emergence and story What manner of foolishness is this Story Surely story is not the stuV of science Im not so sure Story is the natural way we autonomous agents talk about our raw getting on with it mucking through making a living If story is not the stuV of science yet is about how we get on with making our everchanging livings then science not story must change Our making our everchanging livings is part of the unfolding of the physical universeWould you rather be Einstein or Shakespeare Im not sure whose genius is the more awesome I come hesitantly to believe we need both science and story to make sense of a universe in which we agents part of the universe get on with our embodied knowhow we who strut and fret our hour upon the stage Then are heard no more Hardly Our successes and failures trickle tumble and torrentially build the future of our biosphere We Americans fearful of Sputnik land men and mass on the moon Parting we leave mass on the moon and thereby change the orbital dynamics of the solar system and beyond Calculate that Newton genius that you were From what initial and boundary conditions would you could you startBut again we have not had nor have we yet a theory of the propagating coconstructing organization that is a biosphere built of autonomous agents and their shenanigansOh confusion Perhaps a certain confusion is healthy We have not tried to embrace all of this at once beforeHierarchies of Autonomous AgentsFor a start there appears to be an indefinite hierarchy of autonomous agents At least in our biosphere there is a considerable hierarchy of autonomous agents Consider first a singlecell organism prokaryote cells without nuclei such as E coli in your gut E coli my canonical autonomous agent Next consider a eukaryote yeast also in your gut also an autonomous agent In the passage from prokaryote to eukaryotic cell it appears that a collection of autonomous agents came to live together permanently Eukaryotes contain mitochondria and plant cells contain plastids with chlorophyll In both cases these intracellular organelles carry their own DNA with a slightly modified genetic code in the case of mitochondria These facts have suggested to Lynn Margulis the now rather wellaccepted hypothesis that eukaryotic cells are symbionts of two or more earlier separate autonomous agents that contributed the mitochondria the plastids and perhaps the nuclear structure of eukaryotes into a single novel reproducing entity the eukaryotic cellThe eukaryotic cell then is a wellbehaved society of autonomous agents that are now symbiotic hence the eukaryotic cell is a higherorder autonomous agent comprised of lowerorder autonomous agentsBut life has burgeoned beyond singlecelled creatures The sea is filled with eukaryotic colonial organismsmulticellular usually capable of sexual reproduction but also capable of asexual reproduction by budding clumps of cells that reform the various organs feeding tubes mouths stinging cells musculature nerve system Blessed proliferating profusion of ways of beingAnd of course since about billion years ago and surely since the Ediacrin million years ago and the Cambrian period million years ago there have come to exist us multicellular sexually reproducing juggernautsTyrannosaurus rex really was a juggernaut of an autonomous agent A blue whale isnt so trifling either Neither is the wideflung stand of aspen astride the hillsides above Santa Fe largest single stand of aspen in the United States presumably all or most of which is a linked set of trees sprouting from the spreading roots of some initial individual Julius Rebek a chemist now at the Scripps Institute is fond of saying that the biggest molecule he knows of is Number Illinois coal a massive hunk of coal several miles long and wide and hundreds of feet deep Maybe Number Illinois coal is from a single clonally linked stand of aspen cousinsSo we confront a hierarchy of autonomous agents If our definition of an autonomous agent should include that it be an individual capable of reproducing then maybe whales are about as big as such agents get in the current biosphere Thats a long way up in mass and molecules from the minimal autonomous agent I sketched in chapter How far can the hierarchy go Who knowsPerhaps the simplest step in this hierarchy would be the hypothetical and now almost experimentally realized hypercycle invented by Manfred Eigen and Peter Schuster The hypothetical hypercycle consists of a set of replicating RNA sequences say A B C and D each of which is actually a plus and minus strand that are template complements But in addition to A BC and D each replicating individually A helps B replicate B helps C replicate C helps D replicate and D helps A replicate Thinking of each plusminus RNA strand pair as a replicating cycle of two template strands these replicating cycles are linked in the ABCD hypercycleIn fact the hypercycle is a small society of molecular replicators that help one another replicate hence it is a higherorder molecular replicating system Reza Ghadiri has nearly created a peptide hypercycle and probably soon will achieve a real experimental example While the hypercycle of Eigen and Schuster does not yet fulfill my definition of an autonomous agent because no work cycles are done nevertheless we have no trouble imagining a hypercycle of autonomous agents Indeed presumably the eukaryotic cell is more or less just such a hypercycleWe have beginning mathematical models that reveal something about this hierarchical organizationalthough the best current models are curiously limited despite their brillianceWalter Fontana is a theoretical chemist trained by Peter Schuster in Vienna Walter came to the Santa Fe Institute and made a major intellectual step called Alchemy In chapter I described the emergence of autocatalytic sets of molecular species in a chemical reaction graph By rather independent intellectual routes that began with physicist John McCaskills eVorts to create a computer soup of Turing machines that operated on one another Walter invented algorithmic chemistry Naturally and most naturally in Santa Fe where one can be healed by means known nowhere else in the universe Walter nicknamed algorithmic chemistry Alchemy Unlike the alchemy of Newtons time Walters worksHere is alchemy Walter borrowed a computer language known as lisp Lisp expressions can operate on one another So expression encounters expression At random it is decided if will operate on or will operate on Whichever way after the operation the lisp expression that was operated on typically is transformed into a new lisp expressionYou see the analogy to chemistry The transformation of the lisp expression to a new lisp expression is rather like a chemical reaction The operating lisp expression that does the transformation is rather like an enzyme catalyzing a reactionSo Walter let loose a pot full of lisp expressions in a computer These merrily bumped into one another creating new lisp expressions Walter as a good theoretical chemist from the EigenSchuster tradition imagined his algorithmic chemistry in a chemostat that would hold the total number of lisp expressions at a constant So if extra lisp expressions drove the total above Walter randomly chose enough lisp expressions to eliminate from the pot to keep the total at This pruning back to a total of provides a selection pressure for lisp expressions that are formed more often than averageWalter let loose the floodgates of his alchemical world A torrent of ever new lisp expressions then stunningly a few then more often one sees an enlarging population of a subset of alreadyseen lisp expressionsWhat had Walter found The first thing he found were copiers that is lisp expressions that could copy any lisp expression including themselves Once such replicators emerged they took over Walters steaming pot of lisp expressions Indeed such a lisp expression is rather like Jack Szostaks hopedfor RNA polymerase able to copy any RNA sequence including itself Walter called such copiers type organizationsCould other selfreproducing organizations emerge Walter cheated and simply disallowed copier replicators to occur Bereft of copiers Walters soup ripped forward again Again novel lisp expressions came forth in profusion Again after a while a recurrent set of lisp expressions emergedWhat had Walter found He found collectively autocatalytic sets of lisp expressions essentially identical to my collectively autocatalytic sets of polymers Walter called these type organizations In each such collectively autocatalytic lisp set each expression is formed by the action of some lisp expression on some lisp expression in the set The set as a whole is collectively reproducingBut could one find a hierarchy beyond type organizations Further research has gotten as far as a kind of type organization which consists of two or more type organizations that jointly coexist and create a kind of mutual glue of lisp expressions The glue would not be formed by either type organization alone but is the conjoint construction of the plurality of type organizationsSo a modest hierarchy of algorithmic chemical systems has been found The type organizations seem analogical to eukaryotic cells that harbor diVerent replicators mitochondria plasmids nuclei in a common mutual glue of cytoplasm and shared processesCuriously no higherorder organization has yet been seen It is deeply interesting to me that no one knows why What is limiting the persistent emergence of novel reproducing algorithmic systemsIndeed there are now a modest diversity of algorithmic models such as Tom Rays Tierra In Tierra computer strings live in the memory core reproduce and fight one another for space in the core A reaper kills random critters Evolution to form a variety of parasites and hyperparasites occurs including some slightly hierarchical agents Interestingly again the total diversity of types of critters is limitedAs John McCaskill another theoretical physicistchemist in the EigenSchuster group points out no one has succeeded so far in creating an algorithmic system of reproducing entities that generates impressive hierarchical agents or persistent increasingly complex organization Again no one knows whyIt is possible that the constraint to algorithmic critters may be the problem Indeed I will suggest that the biosphere is richer than that which can in the normal senses I know be called algorithmic That which is algorithmic is eVectively constructable by a formal procedure that begins with definable input data and is operated upon by a program in the Turing or von Neumann sense But I will argue that we cannot prestate some biological analogue of the input data nor is there some biological analogue of the program governing the unfolding of a biosphere I will argue that the configuration space of a biosphere cannot be finitely prestated that persistent novelty occurs in the biosphere and universe as a whole And I will opine that if we cannot finitely prestate the configuration space of a biosphere then something is odd with how we have been taught to do our science for in Newtonian physics Einsteins physics and Bohrs physics one can finitely prestate the configuration space in question In chapter borrowing on joint work with quantum gravity scholar and friend Lee Smolin I will suggest that if we cannot prestate the configuration space of a universe then time is real and necessary and that the way a universe constructs itself may have analogies to the way a biosphere constructs itselfRemember a propagating organization that builds itself and persistently ramifies in a nonequilibrium setting is not yet a concept that we understand We have matter energy and entropy but no clear notion of propagating organization in the sense we here struggle to articulate And because the way a biosphere gets on with constructing itself may not be algorithmic it may be that story is part of how we must in fact make sense of the persistent emergence of novelty in the biosphereWell thats a mouthful Well have to struggle below to see if it makes sense and might be correctI want to return to Walter Fontanas algorithmic chemistry to note an interesting feature Lets define higherorder machines in Walters chemistry We might think of bundles of lisp expressions where an input bundle of lisp expressions is fed into an assemblyline bundle of lisp expressions to yield an output bundle Nothing prevents our consideration of such bundles Given a set of possible initial lisp expressions say N diVerent expressions the diVerent subsets or bundles that are possible are just two raised to the Nth power This N set is called the power set of the N symbol strings A bundle acting on a bundle may produce a bundle In general this is just a mapping on the power set in which machine bundles act on input bundles to yield output bundles that is the set of possible input bundles machines and output bundles is the set of possible mappings of the power set into itselfWell obviously one could get bundles of lisp expressionscomplex assembly lines of lisp expressions acting as machines on complex ordered sets of bundled input lisp expressions to yield ordered sets of bundled output lisp expressions Here the ordering of the lisp expressions would define the assemblyline sequence of operations of the machine lisp bundle and the ordering of lisp expressions in the input bundle would define the order in which the machine acted on the set of lisp expressions in the input bundle And just as obviously if Walter got type and type autocatalytic sets of simple lisp expressions one could get type and type autocatalytic sets of machine lisp bundles operating on one another And if sets of machines could be ordered into units to act on sets of input bundles to yield sets of output bundles still higherorder autocatalytic sets of type and type should emergeWhy didnt Walter find these higherorder entities I suspect part of the answer is because nothing in his algorithmic chemistry abets the ordering of lisp expressions into ordered sets treated as units and machines by one another The collective properties of ordered sets of lisp expressions are not recognized and acted upon as collective objects by Walters soup of lisp expressionsBut such limitations seem not to hinder the biosphere We do witness the emergence of molecular assembly lines and molecular assemblages whose collective properties are recognized and acted upon by natural selection The transcription and translation of the DNA code to messenger RNA and protein is one example But there are others Many enzymes form ordered arrays of multimolecular complexes in which a substrate is progressively passed from one to another active site along an analogy to an assembly line These higherorder complexes of molecular devices arise because natural selection is able to act upon the collective properties of such molecular aggregates when those collective properties augment adaptive fitness In eVect natural selection recognizes the life context in which the collective behaviors of these higherorder molecular structures are advantageousIt is important to stress an obvious feature of the biosphere in contrast to the algorithmic computational systems of Fontana Ray and others The algorithmic systems manipulate symbols according to discrete welldefined transformation rules a kind of algebramapping symbols or symbol strings into symbol stringsIn contrast the biosphere is built up of the doings the embodied knowhow carryings on of autonomous agentsreal physical molecular systems grafting a flow of matter and energy constraint construction and organization into their persistent coevolution As we will see belowwhere I give grounds to think that we cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere hence cannot prestate the adaptations that may come to exist in an evolving biospherereal macroscopic physical systems that are autonomous agents may not be constrained in what they can produce as is a formal mathematical algebraic symbol system If so then the algorithmic freedom of a biosphere is deeply important for the science of Newton Einstein and Bohr all suppose prediction by algorithmic calculationIndeed I suspect that the persistent innovations in a biosphere stem in no small measure from the fact that while we cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere the categories relevant to its unfolding novel functionalities the biosphere is not hampered by our failure at categorization Unlike the welldefined and formal transformation rules of an algebra or a calculational process such as lisp the transformation rules of the biosphere enlarge and change in ways that cannot be prespecified As concrete examples consider the evolution of the genetic code and consider the structure of eukaryotic chromosomes whose complex coordinated behaviors underlie both normal mitotic cell division and the astonishing sequence of meiotic reduction cell divisions in which maternal and paternal homologue chromosomes synapse undergo recombination and separate such that the final sperm or egg cell receives at random only one homologue of each parental chromosome The emergence of these complex macromolecular systems has altered the way evolution itself unfoldsRichard Palmer a physicist at Duke University and the Santa Fe Institute has commented to me that physics is used to distinguishing the initial and boundary conditions from the laws But in the evolution of a biosphere the emergence of systems such as the genetic code and meiosis seems rather like the emergence of new laws This has led Palmer to wonder whether the distinction between initial and boundary conditions and laws is really as clean as it appears in say Newtonian physicsThe Furniture of the UniverseAll of this has somehow to do with the question of the furniture of the universe and with the troublesome questions of emergence and reductionism These are contentious issues Philosophers and others have struggled with these issues for years I state merely some of their outlinesThere is a strong form of reductionism the x is nothing but y version We met an example of this form of reductionism earlier in the eVorts to make good on sense data and logical atomism where the hope was to build up an epistemology based on the least questionable propositions namely reports of sense data I seem to hear a middle C note now This seems to feel like a hard flat surface Then the statement A Windsor rocker is in the living room is nothing but a finitely prespecified list of statements about sense dataOn this definition of reductionism a higherlevel concept is reduced to a lowerlevel language if the truth of a defined set of statements in the lower language is both necessary and suYcient for the truth of a statement in the higher language If this could be done then the higherlevel statement is nothing but a shorthand for the list of necessary and suYcient statements in the lower reducing language Thus the truth of the statement There is a Windsor chair in my oYce would be reduced to the truth of some specifiable set of statements about sense data As we saw this eVort failed in the case of statements about physical objects and sense data While it is relatively easy to find suYcient sense data statements it appears to be impossible to finitely specify a set of necessary and suYcient sense data statements whose truth would be interchangeable with true statements about the Windsor chair in my oYceWittgenstein wrote persuasively that the same systematic diYculty was lodged in attempts to reduce one language game to another for example from a description of a legal event to a description in terms of mere human actions to a description in terms of physical events As we noted earlier legal descriptions involve a web of concepts concerning guilt innocence responsibility evidence admissible procedure that are absent from a description of human actions outside of the legal framework And descriptions of human actionsand a fortiori descriptions of the doings of autonomous agents even bacteria acting on their own behalf to get dinnerseem to involve a diVerent language game than mere descriptions in terms of physical eventsAmong other critical features of the actionanddoing language game is that compared to a hypothetical complete physical description the actionanddoing description picks out the relevant features with respect to the goals of the autonomous agent Interestingly once we are at Dennetts level of Popperian creatures which can have internal models of and plans for the future and can have their models die in their stead we seem to have arrived at a level of organization in which actionandgoal talk becomes essential Is there a finitely prestatable set of statements about physical events that is jointly necessary and suYcient for the truth of the statement The cheetah is hunting the gazelle Like other eVorts we will find suYcient conditions but be hard pressed to find jointly necessary and suYcient conditionsThe dictionary hints at where our reductionism ideas may go wrong Every word in the dictionary is defined in terms of other words How could it be otherwise Concepts are defined in webs somehow tacked onto the real world by ostensive definitionsdefinitions given by pointing to examples We carve up the world in a variety of ways Wittgensteins language games that appear not to be reducible to one another in the strict sense of necessary and suYcient conditions And this in turn underlies the question whether legal systems and human actions are parts of the furniture of the universe somehow above or in addition to the locations and motions of atoms and fieldsEven at the level of basic physical theory the same issues arise For example classical thermodynamics is a welldefined science in its own right Ludwig Boltzmann Willard Gibbs and others struggled to invent statistical mechanics based on Newtonian laws operating on a set of idealized particles in the Ndimensional phase space we have discussed It is generally seen as a triumph that the classical thermodynamic concepts of temperature pressure and entropy were reduced to statistical features of idealized sets of gas particles temperature becoming the average kinetic energy of the particles pressure the momentum transferred to the walls of the vessel and entropy a measure of the number of microstates per macrostateBut before complete triumph is declared we should ask whether statistical mechanics constitutes a set of necessary and suYcient statements with respect to classical thermodynamics The answer appears to be no While statistical mechanics based on Newtonian forces yields a set of suYcient conditions that statistical mechanics is not jointly necessary and suYcient David Gross and other physicist colleagues have confirmed to me that one could construct diVerent consistent statistical mechanics based on particles following nonNewtonian laws all of which would be interpretable as reductions of classical thermodynamics So even at the heart where reduction is supposed to have taken place there seems to be no finitely prestateable set of necessary and suYcient conditions on a lower level over a set of possible statistical mechanics that would jointly suYce for a reduction of classical thermodynamicsThe same problem arises with Darwinian theory Darwin tells us that evolution occurs by reproduction with heritable variation and natural selection Our biology based on DNA and RNA and proteins is an instantiation a suYcient condition for Darwinian evolution Could we now state all possible physical systems that might be capable of replication heritable variation and natural selection I think notThere is a weaker sense of reductionism namely the casting of an account of a higherlevel object concept or phenomenon in terms of a suYcient but not necessary and suYcient set of conditions at a lower level In this sense statistical mechanics surely does account for classical mechanics Many argue that this weaker sense of reductionism suYces Well suYces for what That is a bit harder to be clear about Roughly the temptation is to say Temperature is nothing but the average kinetic energy of the atoms in the system that is we appear to reduce the ontological furniture of the universeI suspect that this familiar ontological move is not always warranted Lets take some cases that Phil Anderson uses to exemplify emergence Gold is a yellow malleable metal familiar to all of us Nowhere in the quantum mechanical description of atomic gold are these macroscopic properties to be found Moreover there is no deductive way to arrive at these macroscopic collective properties from the underlying quantum mechanics of atoms of gold Rather we observe the macroscopic properties find lawful features of those properties then attempt to link them to suYcient conditions in our quantum mechanical description of matterAnother class of cases Anderson refers to is broken symmetries A familiar example would be a pole standing vertically on an horizontal slab on the earths surface The vertical pole is unstable in the face of gravity and will soon fall It might fall and point in any direction Hence the system has the full symmetry of the plane prior to the falling of the pole In due course the pole does fall over and points in some specific direction Thereby the symmetry of the system prior to falling has been broken We cannot deduce from the symmetry of the initial state how that symmetry will be brokenPhil entitled his article relevant to this issue of emergence More Is DiVerentLets try it with my definition of autonomous agents As I have already hinted systems capable of selfreproduction and thermodynamic work cycles are presumably not limited to our current DNA RNA proteinbased cells Almost certainly pure protein and small molecule systems can be autonomous agents Almost certainly pure RNA and small molecule systems can be autonomous agents But perhaps selfgravitating systems lasing systems and a variety of other physical systems can be autonomous agentsAgain we can give several suYcient conditions but apparently we cannot finitely prespecify a set of necessary and suYcient conditions that would allow us to prespecify all the possible patterns of construction constraint and organization of physical processes and matter flows that would constitute an autonomous agentOn the other hand my definition does seem to aVord a postconstruction test Bring us a candidate autonomous agent and we can ask of it Do you reproduce yourself and carry out at least one thermodynamic work cycle The answer is either yes or no and is an objective fact about the entity in question So one begins to see a pattern here We may not be able to finitely prespecify all the possible systems that constitute an autonomous agent but we can recognize one when we see it We can give suYcient but not necessary and suYcient conditions for all physical realizations of an autonomous agent and we can check any specific candidate case Further any specific candidate case either is or is not an autonomous agent The statement The bacterium is an autonomous agent is either true or falseBased on this I want to say that autonomous agents are parts of the ontological furniture of the universe I also want to say with Phil Anderson that emergence is real and utterly nonmysteriousOn this view of emergence the autonomous agent is more than the sum of its parts but not in the sense that the behavior of the autonomous agent is not explicable as the total organization of the parts organized into the whole agent in its environment Rather an autonomous agent is more than the sum of its parts in the sense that a wide varietyindeed an indefinite varietyof physical systems could be autonomous agents in the same sense selfreproducing systems carrying out at least one work cycleNow we can turn to causality The nothing but version of reduction an autonomous agent is nothing but has tended historically to see causality as running only upward from the behaviors of atoms to their causal consequences in the behavior of larger entities such as tigersBut I find myself troubled by this view and will provide an example of why Millions of years ago the last female trilobite Tomasina was hurrying to find a good place to lay her eggs Suddenly Tomasina saw a hideous starfish named Darthvader dead ahead Left or right What shall I do she wondered Tomasina jumped left Darthvader jumped right caught Tomasina killed her and devoured her and her eggsThere are no more trilobites Moreover when Tomasina died she took with her the unique proteins and small molecules that were trilobite molecular species These kinds of molecules are gone from the biosphere So too are descendant mutant molecules that might have arisen from further speciation from Tomasinas tribe Furthermore other chemical reactions which might have been catalyzed transforming some molecular species to others that Tomasinas molecules and those of her descendants might have catalyzed have perhaps never come to be in the biosphere that has evolved over the succeeding eonsNow Tomasina is lost as an entire organism acting in an environment Yet the causal consequences of her wrong guess of direction to jump have propagated downward to lower levels of organization namely the molecular species of which the biosphere is composedDownward causation is real and nonmystical There are now more old tires along roadsides than wagon wheels The car has replaced the ConestogaI distrust a reductionism that sees causality as bottom up In what sense is Tomasina nothing but the atoms and their locations and motions in threedimensional space of which she was comprised The concepts of atoms in motion in threedimensional space do not appear to entail the concepts of an autonomous agent selfconsistent constraint construction release of energy propagating work tasks and the closure of catalysis tasks and other features that constitutes the propagating organization that is an autonomous agent or a coevolving ecology of autonomous agents In one sense of course there is nothing but the atoms in motion in threedimensionalspace in Tomasina But the historical coming into existence of life in the universe of autonomous agents and of the propagating organization that is Tomasina and her bioworld is nowhere accounted for by Newtons laws What after all do Newtons laws of motion have to do with a suYcient account of Tomasinas jump to the left rather than the right Is Tomasina as a whole organism part of the furniture of the universe YesAdaptations Exaptations and the Impossibility to Finitely Prestate the Configuration Space of a BiosphereOne contentious issue leads us to another And now I hope to trouble you deeplyTomasina was but one of many lineages of creatures evolving much as Darwin taught us by heritable variation and natural selection Lets turn to a Darwinian account of the function of the heart Roughly Darwin would say the function of the heart is to pump blood Namely Darwin would say this causal consequence of the heart is the virtue for which it was and persistently is selected by natural selection I tend to think Darwins account of the heart is correct Notice that the form of the account is ontological Hearts came into existence somehow and are sustained because it is advantageous to organisms to have a means to pump bloodBut the heart has other causal consequences For example the heart makes heart sounds as its valves open and close Presumably heart sounds are not the causal consequences of the heart upon which natural selection has acted Heart sounds are not the function of the heartIt is precisely this point that the function of a part of an organism is a subset of its causal consequences to which I appealed earlier in stating that in an autonomous agent discerning the work task done by the constrained release of energy required finding the subset of causal consequences of that work task that were functionally important to the life cycle of the autonomous agent in its environment and therefore were presumably selected and sustained by natural selection My point was that we cannot know the functions of parts except in the context of the whole autonomous agent in its environmentBut now we come to a more radical issue Darwinian preadaptations or in Stephen J Goulds term exaptations Darwin noted that in an appropriate environment a causal consequence of a part of an organism that had not been of selective significance might come to be of selective significance and hence be selected Thereupon that newly important causal consequence would be a new function available to the organismTake a fanciful case in point The human heart not only makes heart sounds but it also is a set of resonant chambers Suppose you were in Los Angeles felt something odd in your chest and thought My God An earthquake You did whatever the right thing was and survived alone among millions Your heart happened to be preadapted to pick up earthquake pretremors Now suppose you marry and have children who inherit your fatefully preadapted heart and suppose earthquakes arose often enough for this new capacity to oVer survival advantage to you and your oVspring Soon a subspecies of Homo sapiens would arise with earthquake detectors in their chest Not badNow evolution by such preadaptations or exaptations are not rare they are the grist of adaptive evolution Thus arose the lung the ear flight presumably most major adaptations and presumably many or even all minor ones as well It suYces for my purposes that many adaptations arise as Darwins preadaptations or Goulds exaptationsHere now is my troublesome question Do you think that you could state ahead of time all the possible causal consequences of bits and pieces of organisms that might in some odd circumstances or another turn out to be preadaptations and hence be selected and come to exist in the biosphere Stated more starkly do you think that you can finitely prestate all the contextdependent causal consequences of parts of all possible organisms that might be preadaptations hence be selected and come to exist in the biosphereI believe and it is a matter of central importance if I am correct that the answer is no I do not think it is possible to finitely prestate all the contextdependent causal consequences of parts of creatures that might turn out to be useful in some weird environment and hence be selected Im not yet certain how to prove that this is not possible although I will have a try at it belowAnother way of stating what I am driving at is this Is there a finitely prestatable set of all the possible potential biological functions Again I think the answer is no Yet another way of stating this is to say that there is no finite prestatement of the configuration space of a biosphere We cannot say ahead of time all the possible constellations of matter energy process and organization that is a kind of basis set for a biosphere in the sense that the atomic chart of the elements is a finite basis set for all of chemistryIt is time for a story A particularly ugly squirrel named Gertrude was atop a tree years ago Gertrude was ugly because she had folds of skin from her forearms stretching to her hind limbs So ugly was Gertrude that she was shunned by the other squirrels and was sadly alone atop a magnolia tree eating lunch But just yards away high in a pine was Bertha an owl Bertha spotted Gertrude and thought Lunch Bertha flashed downward through shafts of light toward Gertrude Gertrude looked suddenly up and was terrified GAAAAAAH she cried and jumped in desperation from the top of the magnolia tree flinging her arms and legs wide in terrorAnd Gertrude flew Yes she flew away from the magnolia tree eluding the bewildered Bertha Later that month Gertrude was married in a civil ceremony to a handsome squirrel as she had become a heroine was no longer shunned and was considered a prize mate Her odd flaps turned out to be a consequence of a simple Mendelian dominant gene hence her kids had the same wondrous capacity to flyAnd that is how flying squirrels got their wings more or lessNow after the fact after Gertrude jumped in terror from the magnolia tree we would all say in wonder Did you see what Gertrude just did And we would tell the story of Gertrude But could we have said beforehand that Gertrudes ugly skin flaps would happen to be of use that day Perhaps perhaps not Could we have said it four billion years ago Or said it today about all possible future exaptations No Was some known law of physics violated by Gertrude NoNow a story about tractors It is said and I choose to believe it true that some engineers were hard at it trying to invent the tractor Good idea a tractor was the collective wisdom Needing lots of power the engineers began with a huge engine block and sought to mount the block on a chassis But the engine block was so massive that it crushed chassis after chassis The engineers were stumped Then one day one of the engineers said You know the engine block is so rigid we could use the engine block itself as the chassis and hang everything else oV the engine block And so thats how the tractor got its chassis And the chassis is just another Darwinian preadaptation or Gouldian exaptationA brief history of the origin of writing In the early Near East loans of sheep and goats were common The borrower would give the lender a small closed vessel of baked clay containing a number of stones equal to the number of borrowed sheep Upon return of the sheep the vessel would be broken open and the stones counted to make sure as many sheep were returned as had been borrowedBut sometimes the clay vessels were broken accidentally by the lender before the time of return of the sheep When the vessel was broken sometimes the stones would fall out and become lost The lender could not be sure he had recovered all his sheep So people started making scratch marks near the top of the vessel before they baked the clay to denote the number of stones placed inside the closed vessel One day it dawned on someone that with the scratch marks on the surface of the clay vessel the stones inside were not needed They smoothed the clay and began keeping notes of loaned sheep by marks baked into the clay Cuneiform writing beganDo you think you could finitely prestate all the contextdependent causal consequences of human artifacts that might turn out to be useful in some odd environment or for some odd purpose I dont think so It is not that we cannot finitely prestate some infinite things For example Fourier had a wonderful idea Sine and cosines you know he muttered to himself in French All possible wavelengths out to infinity down to infinitesimal all possible phase oVsets Haha And Fourier proved his theorem that any wiggly line on a plane surface could be approximated to arbitrary accuracy with a weighted set of phaseoVset sines and cosines drawn from the infinite basis set of all sine and cosine functions Fourier finitely prestated an infinite basis set for all continuous diVerentiable wiggly lines on long blackboardsBut can we finitely prestate all possible exaptations for all possible organisms or even the current organisms in our biosphere Again while Im still not certain how to prove my claim I claim the answer is no We cannot prestate the configuration space of the biosphere But notice our failure is not hindering the biosphere from exapting all the time Gertrude did it And every bacterium whose molecules wiggle in a useful way that turn out to detect a source of energy or danger or opportunity in some novel fashion tends to be selected for that novel functionality Look at the rate of emergence of bacteria resistant to our antibiotics and the myriad unexpected ways such resistance arises at the molecular level Who could have foretold the waysThe example of the common emergence of Darwinian preadaptations in the biosphere may point to an interesting connection with the diYculty Fontana and others have had achieving the persistent emergence of more complexity in algorithmic models such as alchemy and Tierra Gertrude did fly and thereby the capacity of her folds of skin to function as wings were selected Flying squirrels came to exist in the universe Restated a property of Gertrudeindeed here a collective property of her atomic constituentsmade itself manifest in the real physical world in a context that lent survival advantage to Gertrude Were we to have a formal algorithmic description of a formal simulated algorithmic Gertrude that did not have as an algorithmic consequence that her skin flaps might function as wings then the emergence of the higherorder category of winged squirrel could not be derived algorithmically Similarly were we to have a formal description of an engine block that did not include its rigidity we could not algorithmically derive that the engine block could be used as a chassisBut we might ask could we not have a complete physical description of Gertrude or the engine block such that all possible properties might be derived from that complete physical description The answer is almost certainly no It is an old philosophic realization that there is no finite description of a simple physical object in its context For example the coVee table in my living room is made of three wooden planks four short squat legs runners between all pairs of legs The middle board has a crack in it some eight inches long a quarter of an inch wide at the end of the board narrowing to nothing along a particular curved arc A second crack smaller is six inches from the first crack A cracker is on the table A personal computer is on the table The first crack is seven feet from the door The second crack is seven feet six inches from the door Both cracks are miles from the moon and light years from the nearest star A dead grasshopper is on the table to the left of the end of the first crack and about light years from the nearest star A mote of dust hovers an inch above the table two inches from a leaf that drifts down from a ficus in the living roomYou get the sense that there is no complete description of the table Why does it matter Because I myself made an exaptation of which I am deeply proud You see I was worried one day that my wife or adult son might knock my PC oV the table so I wedged the power cord into the first crack and plugged the cord into a floor socket Thereby my PC worked on the table and couldnt be knocked oV easily You can understand my pride here as with my Rube Goldberg device to water my bean fieldBut even this tiny invention this tiny exaptation could not readily have been finitely prestated How would one in describing all the contextdependent features of the table happen to list the crack and its distance to the floor socket that happen to turn out to be relevant for my brilliant solution of a sudden problem In short there seems to be no finitely prestatable eVective procedure to list all the contextdependent features of objects and organs that might prove useful for some oddball purpose by some organism My invention the tractor invention the cuneiform invention and Gertrudes invention were all genuine novelties in the universeThis brings us to a wondrous set of issues You see we have indeed been taught by our physicist friends to do science by prestating the configuration space in question Consider our now rather tired example of statistical mechanics with Avogadros number of gas particles in a liter container First note that we can finitely specify ahead of time the Ndimensional configuration space of the gas that is all the positions and momenta of the N gas particles in threedimensionalspace inside the liter box Then Boltzmann assumed the ergodic hypothesis about wandering all over the configuration space did the calculations and lo statistical mechanics is upon usNow Newtonian mechanics Prestate the initial and boundary conditions the particles and force laws and with them the possible configuration space and calculate away So too in general relativity Given Einsteins equations prestate the initial and boundary conditions and seek solutions Solutions are possible universes The set of possible solutions is the configuration space allowed by general relativity And in quantum mechanics one talks of specifying the classical conditions of the experiment and thereby the configuration space of the quantum system preparing an initial state and using Schrdingers equation to propagate amplitudes for the entire future evolution in the configuration space for all conceivable observables Again in quantum mechanics in any specific context the configuration space is to be finitely prestatable then we follow the deterministic time evolution of the Schrdinger equation in configuration space square the resulting amplitudes to predict the probabilities of measurements and then carry out macroscopic measurements We know the configuration space ahead of timeBut what if we cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere In that case the way Newton taught us to do science is not the whole story We cannot calculate as he did And in fact biologists do not often do science as Newton taught We carry on an odd mixture of historical analysis of the actual branching pathways of evolution a dollop of theory about evolutionary landscapes molecular evolution and coevolution and ecosystems and a lot of detailed experimental work to understand how actual creatures develop how their life cycles unfold how they assemble into ecosystems and so forthAnd biologists tell stories If I am right if the biosphere is getting on with it muddling along exapting creating and destroying ways of making a living then there is a central need to tell stories If we cannot have all the categories that may be of relevance finitely prestated ahead of time how else should we talk about the emergence in the biosphere or in our historya piece of the biosphereof new relevant categories new functionalities new ways of making a living These are the doings of autonomous agents Stories not only are relevant they are how we tell ourselves what happened and its significanceits semantic importIn short we do not deduce our lives we live them Stories are our mode of making sense of the contextdependent actions of us as autonomous agents And metaphor If we cannot deduce it all if the biospheres ramblings are richer than the algorithmic then metaphor must be part of our cognitive capacity to guide action in the absence of deductionIndeed in biology itself the narrative stance is gaining in popularity Did you see what Gertrude pulled oV Thats how flying squirrels evolved Dominant Mendelian gene you see easily selected once the right environmental conditions arose The propagating exapting biosphere is getting on with it and it appears that we crucially need stories to do some of the telling of that getting on with itHow odd C P Snow wrote of the two cultures science and the humanities never to mix Our inability to prestate the configuration space of a biosphere foretells a deepening of science a search for story and historical contingency yet a place for natural lawsForever CreativeIn this chapter I have been trying to say argue articulate the possibility that a biosphere is profoundly generativesomehow fundamentally always creative The cornerstone of this dawning near conviction lies in the belief I now hold with some confidence that we cannot finitely prestate the configuration space of a biosphere New variablesthe genetic code recombination Gertrudes wings writing the tractorpersistently emerge New language games and living games emerge What is the status of my claim that we cannot finitely prestate the configuration space of a biosphere I do think my claim is true But why I am not sure It is wise to explore some possible reasonsA first possibility is that the biosphere like a complex algorithm unfolds in ways that cannot be foretold Recall that for many algorithms the behavior of the algorithm cannot be prestated in any form more compressed than simply watching the program unfold The famous halting problem is the classic example For many algorithms that are to compute an answer then halt we cannot say ahead of time whether the computer will halt in finite timeI do not think the biosphere is akin to this diYculty with many algorithms If we consider such algorithms the building blocks of the algorithmsfor example the binary symbols and the operations of addition subtraction multiplication division exponentiation and root taking and control operations such as If such and such then do so and so otherwise do this and Do loopsare wellstated crisp mathematical primitives Our uncertainty about the unfolding of an algorithm does not lie in uncertainty about the primitives but about the consequences of the arrangements of these agreed upon primitives in a given computer code For example will the algorithm based on those primitives halt or not halt in finite timeBut among the exaptations in a biosphere are those that appear to alter the primitive objects and control operations Thus the evolution of chromosomes that replicate and partition to daughter cells the evolution of the genetic code and the evolution of controlled recombination all seem to be the evolution of the generative machinery of evolution itself Insofar as this is true our incapacity to prestate the configuration space of the biosphere is not a failure to prestate the consequences of the primitives it appears to be a failure to prestate the primitives themselvesLets consider the possibility that the incapacity to finitely prestate the configuration space of a biosphere is related to Godels theorem Godel demonstrated that for axiomatic systems as rich or richer than arithmetic given a set of axioms there were always statements that were true but not formally derivable from the axioms In addition Godel showed that it was always possible to enrich the axiom set and from that enriched axiom set it would be possible to prove the formally true but unprovable statements in the formal system On the other hand he also showed that the new enriched axiom system would itself have still further formally true but unprovable statementsI am not persuaded that the uncertainty about the configuration space of a biosphere is analogous to true but formally undecidable statements in a formal system I base this upon an analogy between formal proof and causal consequences The same parallel was pointed out by Robert Rosen in his book Life Itself If we are to represent causal consequences by a formal system then the concept of a proof derived by formal procedures from axiomsor more generally the concept of a trajectory in a state space where successive states along a trajectory are derived by a formal procedure such as integration of the diVerential equations representing the systemis the natural way to represent causal consequence If this parallelism is taken seriously then statements in a formal language that are true but unprovable in that formal language can have no causal pathwaythat is prooffrom the axioms to the desired consequence But this analogy seems to fail with respect to the evolution of the biosphere There is a perfectly fine causal account of Gertrude and her maiden flight We can reconstruct that account after the fact even if we could not have predicted it Thus it does not seem that our diYculty in prestating all exaptations is the same as the mathematical fact of formally undecidable statements in an axiom systemOn the other hand there may be a parallel between the exaptations of which we have spoken and Godels theorem and the augmentation of the axiom set such that formerly unprovable statements become provable That is the emergence of novel exaptations in evolution do seem rather like the emergence of novel primitive objects and primitive control operationshence novel axioms In the examples above the emergence of the genetic code and the emergence of chromosomes that duplicate and partition daughter chromosomes into two daughter cells the evolution of controlled recombination seem to become instantiated as biological laws even though they are entirely historically contingent Changing the biological laws in evolution seems rather like the generation of a novel axiom from which new consequences can be derivedOn this interpretation my claim that we cannot finitely prestate the configuration space of a biosphere becomes the claim that the biosphere keeps generating new causal axioms from which it generates novel forms Then just as we do not know where the new axioms of a formal system come from save as the free invention of the logician involved so it would seem that we cannot prestate the new generative exaptations that allow evolution to drive in new directions I am not entirely persuaded by this analogy to finding ever new axioms in Godels theorem but it does have some coherenceIndeed the failure to be able to prestate the configuration space of the biosphere may be yet deeper I will take a stab at a proof I begin by vitiating my assumption that one cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere then try to show that the implications are that the number of potentially relevant properties is vastly hyperastronomical and that there is no way in the lifetime of the universe for any knower within the universe to enumerate let alone work with all the possible properties or categories and their causal consequencesLets restrict attention to a model of a molecule a square x array of magnetic dipoles called spins that can point only up or down So our little system has spins Thus I begin by vitiating my assertion and telling us what the configuration space is it has something to do with the spin configurations Well how many diVerent spin configurations are there Two raised to the th power Now what might we want to call a category or a property A sensible thought is that a category or class is some collection of the possible spin configurations say the configuration with all spins up plus all the configurations with no more than two spins down How many such possible classes are there The answer is the power set raised to the raised to the This is a gargantuan number It corresponds roughly to raised to the raised to the th That is the number of possible static categories of our tiny spin system is about raised to the power written with with zeros after it By comparison the estimated number of particles in the known universe is about raised to the th powerBut we have so far considered only static categoriespossible subsets of states of the spin system Suppose the spins can flip Then the spin system can pass from one configuration to another Suppose that the motions of the spin system are confined to closed cycles in the space of configurations that is simple orbits Each of our to the to the static categories is a set of one or more spin configurations The number of possible orbits through that set is the factorial of the number of members of the set The number of orbits among configurations that constitute the power set of classes of the spins is vastly larger than the number of static categoriesOn the other hand arbitrary motion among spin states may be unreasonable Instead the flow among spin configurations may be constrained by the energy couplings among the spins Physicists will properly talk of the Hamiltonian function that gives the energy of each spin configuration Grant such a Hamiltonian say a spinglass Hamiltonian where a spin glass is a disordered magnetic material Then the system at finite temperature may wander through the square root of its states hence about states in some complex patternsNow consider two such molecular systems each merely x spins each governed by a spinglass Hamiltonian function and let the two molecular systems interact in an aqueous medium As the two touch one another and jiggle near one another the coupled system performs some very complex dance of spin motions In general the equations describing that motion cannot be solved analytically but would have to be solved by numerical simulation That is there is no short description of the behavior of the system of equations they must instead be solved by an algorithmic system that follows the trajectory in the state space of the system by tiny incremental steps It becomes easy to conjure multimolecular systems indeed autonomous agents are examples in which even if the Hamiltonian for each single system and all the coupled systems were known it would not be possible to compute the detailed dynamics of the coupled spin system in the lifetime of the universeBut it is just such detailed wiggling by the coupled system that allows discovery of the preadaptation that a particular wiggling of one molecule senses a subset of states of another molecule and is useful for some survival purpose The behaviors of the collective set of molecules among the coevolving autonomous agents stumble upon then reinforce by heritable variation the odd molecular motions that capture photons that sense energy sources that are the finegrained molecular exaptations that are the daily stuV of evolutionWe cannot compute it There is a sense in which the computations are transfinitenot infinite but so vastly large that they cannot be carried out by any computational system in the universe Indeed one can consider the known radius of the universe at the Planck length and Planck timescale and can imagine all the events that have happened within any causally connected light cone that might therefore carry out a computation While vast there are combinatorial problems that are still vaster Presumably no physical process in the unfolding universe could have foreknowledge of all features of such problems Nor would there be an eVective procedure to prepare the cosmic computer in a proper initial state read in the data and read out its computationMy best bet is that the incapacity to finitely prestate the configuration space of a biosphere is deeply related to the incapacity to enumerate and predict all the possible detailed dynamics of coupled molecular systems by any computational system in the universe In turn this incapacity is I suspect deeply related to the gargantuan nonergodicity of the historical universe that I discuss in the next chapter And as we shall see in detail the exaptations of Gertrude and others leaves macroscopic living footprints propagating frozen accidents on the history of the universe The universe in its persistent becoming is richer than all our dreamings Chapter The Nonergodic UniverseThe Possibility of New Lawsrom a biosphere and its mysteries this investigation now steps gingerly toward the cosmos Caveat lector I am not a physicistOur now familiar liter of gas particles at room temperature comes to equilibrium rapidly certainly on the order of hours or days Equilibrium means roughly that the macroscopic properties of the system such as temperature and pressure have stopped changing except for small square root N fluctuations away from equilibrium that soon dissipate back toward equilibrium As we have noted thanks to the ergodic hypothesis the gas system ultimately visits each macrostate at a number of times proportional to the number of microstates in that macrostate For equilibrium with respect to all macroscopic properties to have been attained it is not necessary that all microstates have been sampled of course but that the statistical distribution of microstates approaches the equilibrium distributionPhysicist Richard Feynman noted that equilibrium is when all the fast things have happened and the slow ones have not His dictum suggests accurately that the notion of equilibrium is not quite so selfevidentThe aim of the current chapter is to explore the profound failure on the scale of a suciently large closed thermodynamic system and a fortiori the open system of the biosphere to come close to equilibrium on vastly long time scales with respect to the lifetime of the universe The main facts are known to physicists of course The universe is vastly nonergodic above modest levels of molecular complexity let alone with respect to gross motions of parts of the universe with respect to one anotherGiven that the universe is actually nonergodic nonrepeating and in macroscopically important ways over a time scale vastly longer than the lifetime of the universe we are entitled to broach the question of whether there might be general laws governing some or all aspects of this nonergodic behavior No one knows but I will raise a possibility that has a chance to be true for a biosphere There is little harm in wondering if it might hint at a fourth law of thermodynamics for selfconstructing systems such as biospheresThe Actual and the Adjacent PossibleI now want to reintroduce a central concept of alarming simplicity Consider all the kinds of organic molecules on within or in the vicinity of the Earth say out to twice the radius of the moon Call that set of organic molecules the actualNow recall the concept of a reaction graph a bipartite graph with nodes representing chemical species and lines called hyperedges leading from each set of substrates to a box and from the box to the product species of that particular reaction Recall that we utilized arrows on the lines to distinguish substrates from products but that the direction of flow of the reaction depended upon the displacement of the substrates and products of that reaction from the equilibrium concentrations for that reaction That equilibrium ratio corresponds to the concentrations of substrates versus products where the net rate of production of products from substrates equals the net rate of production of substrates from productsThe reaction graph is just the set of all the molecular species and all the hyperedges representing all the reactions among the species Thus consider the reaction graph among the molecular species in the actual where at present presumably hundreds of trillions of molecular species existNow consider the adjacent possible of the reaction graph of the actual The adjacent possible consists of all those molecular species that are not members of the actual but are one reaction step away from the actual That is the adjacent possible comprises just those molecular species that are not present in the vicinity of the Earth out to twice the radius to the moon but can be synthesized from the actual molecular species in a single reaction step from substrates in the actual to products in the adjacent possibleNote that the adjacent possible is indefinitely expandable Once members have been realized in the current adjacent possible a new adjacent possible accessible from the enlarged actual that includes the novel molecules from the former adjacent possible becomes availableNote that the biosphere has been expanding on average into the adjacent possible for billion years Presumably when life started there was a modest variety of a few tens to a few hundreds of organic molecular speciesmethane hydrogen cyanide the familiar list If there are now a standing diversity of million species and each had a hundred thousand genes and genes in each species were at least slightly dierent from genes in all other species then not counting molecular diversity within species the number of genes is trillion Given RNA protein polysaccharides lipids and other organic molecular species the diversity is likely to be hundreds of trillions or moreSomething has obviously happened in the past billion years The biosphere has expanded indeed more or less persistently exploded into the everexpanding adjacent possible The secular diversity of organic molecular species has increased on average over the past billion yearsIt is more than slightly interesting that this fact is clearly true that it is rarely remarked upon and that we have no particular theory for this expansion Indeed I note for future reference that the standing diversity of species in the biosphere has on average with noticeable crashes in large extinction events increased over the past billion years And among us mere humans the diversity of ways of making a living has increased dramatically over the past million years the past hundred thousand years and even over the past thousand years If you wanted a rabbit for dinner thirty thousand years ago you bloody well went out and caught a rabbit Now most of us can go buy a rabbit dinner Something again has happened At the level of species and ways of making a living in the econosphere the actual has expanded into a persistent adjacent possibleWe are all parts of the universe So in our little hunk of the universe with the sun shining beatifically upon us rather remarkable goings on have occurred Indeed the biosphere may be one of the most complex things in the universeNow a second simple point The molecular species of the actual exist Those in the adjacent possible do not existat least within the volume of the universe we are talking about which we can expand in a moment to be the actual molecular diversity of the entire universe not just our tiny patch of itThe chemical potential of a single reaction with a single set of substrates and no products is perfectly definable both the enthalpy and entropy But we hardly need that sophistication The substrates are present in the actual and the products are not present in the actual but only in the adjacent possible It follows that every such reaction couple is displaced from its equilibrium in the direction of an excess of substrates compared to its products This displacement constitutes a chemical potential driving the reaction toward equilibrium The simple conclusion is that there is a real chemical potential from the actual to the adjacent possible Other things being equal the total system wants to flow into the adjacent possibleIf there are to trillion organic molecules in the biosphere and each pair of organic molecules can undergo at least one two substratetwo product reaction then the diversity of reactions is the square of the diversity of molecular species hence about x Some substantial fraction of these reactions flow from the actual to the adjacent possible The total chemical potential from the actual into the adjacent possible is hard to estimate but it is certainly not smallThe Nonergodicity of the UniverseA further point is of fundamental importance in my view The universe at levels of complexity of complex organic molecules is vastly nonergodicConsider the number of possible proteins of length That is we consider proteins made of the familiar kinds of standard encoded amino acids and thus linear chains of such amino acids Since there are choices at each of positions the number of possible proteins of length is raised to the th power or approximately raised to the th power Now lets consider the estimated number of particles in the known universe which is Thus the maximum number of pairwise collisions that could occur in any instant ignoring distances between particles is that number squared or A fast reaction occurs in a femtosecond or one part in seconds Then the number of pairwise collisions and reactions that can have occurred since the estimated time of the big bang fourteen billion years ago is times the number of femtoseconds since the big bang which is about The total number of reactions on a femtosecond timescale cannot be larger than a very very big number But is infinitesimally small compared to the number of possible proteins of length namely In short the known universe has not had time since the big bang to create all possible proteins of length once Indeed the time required to create all possible proteins at least once is at least the ratio of possible proteins to the maximum number of reactions that can have occurred in the lifetime of the universe or times the lifetime of the universeLet that sink in It would take at least to the th times the current lifetime of the universe for the universe to manage to make all possible proteins of length at least once Obviously with respect to proteins of length the universe is vastly nonergodic It cannot have equilibrated over all these possible dierent moleculesAt a level of complexity above atomic nuclei once into the realm of complex molecules the universe will not cannot come to equilibrium on vastly long timescales compared to its historical age Indeed the giant cold molecular clouds in galaxies about degrees absolute in temperature are highly complex mixtures of molecular species many carbonaceous as well as the birthplace of stars We will return in a moment to wonder about whether a galaxy considered as a closed thermodynamic system reaches equilibrium chemicallyWhat about the arbitrary restriction to a femtosecond The fastest known timescale is the Planck timescale one in to the rd parts of a second or seconds At the Planck timescale therefore the universe can have created at most proteins of length compared to such proteins It would take the known universe chunking along on the Planck timescale times its current lifetime to make all proteins of length Now many biological proteins are of length or even amino acids Hence the number of possible proteins of length does its now familiar hyperastronomical combinatorial explosion to or The universe can have managed to make to the of these at the Planck timescaleForget it The universe is vastly nonequilibrium vastly nonergodic at the level of complex organic molecules A fortiori the universe is vastly nonergodic at the level of species languages legal systems and Chevrolet trucksIt follows that even if we consider the universe as a whole at the levels of molecular and organizational complexity of proteins and up the universe is kinetically trapped It has gotten where it has gotten from wherever it started by whatever process of flow into a persistently expanding adjacent possible but cannot have gotten everywhere The ergodic hypothesis fails us here on any relevant timescaleMore the biosphere and the universe as a whole may well be kinetically trapped into an evermore astonishingly small region of the entire space of the possible it might have reached Stated otherwise the set of actual small molecules and large molecules such as proteins that do exist now is presumably an increasingly tiny subvolume of the total set that might have arisen by now in the biosphere or the universe since the big bangThis nonergodicity is puzzling Just what for example does this mean with respect to the second law stating that thermodynamically isolated chemical systems approach equilibrium and their entropy increases to a maximum In the familiar setting of a liter of gas at room temperature equilibrium of macroscopic features is attained rapidly and small macroscopic fluctuations such as deviation from chemical equilibrium among a fixed set of molecular species damp out fairly rapidly By contrast consider a giant cold molecular cloud in a spiral galaxy with about a hundred million solar masses ignore gravitational eects and just consider the ongoing complex chemical reactions on the complex dust particles that exist in those clouds The specific molecular configurations that arise almost certainly include molecular species that are ever unique in the history of the universe If we may consider unique molecular species as macroscopic features of the cloud then these fluctuations in macroscopic properties do not damp out rather they form the nexus for the generation of still new unique molecular species A specific cloud like our biosphere presumably becomes kinetically trapped into a very special set of complex molecular species that happen to have formed as the cloud evolvesIn short since the relevant timescale for the ergodic hypothesis to hold is vastly longer than the actual present history of the universe the macroscopic features of the universe with respect to the specific sets of complex molecules that exist on this planetin giant cold molecular clouds and so forthare kinetically trapped into an infinitesimal subset of those molecular species that might have come into existence in an ensemble of dierent histories of the universeMy quip above about the nonergodicity of the universe with respect to species languages legal systems and Chevrolet trucks was not a jest We noted in the previous chapter that autonomous agents can form hierarchieshypercycles made of replicators linked in a cycle of mutual benefit are but the simplest case The symbiotic construction of eukaryotic cells by merging of dierent bacterial forms to create mitochondria and chloroplasts and perhaps cell nuclei are another case So too are multicelled organisms such as starfish and ourselves These hierarchically complex autonomous agents have do and will invade an adjacent possible definable at least at the chemical level but also on morphological levels behavioral levels and beyond At all levels the biosphere has been invading a persistent adjacent possible for billion yearsWhich leads to an odd thought The indefinite hierarchy upward in complexity is a sink where the burgeoning order of the universe constructed by such agents can be dumped The biosphere has been doing this dumping for billion yearsNow here are some further odd thoughts There is an absolute zero temperature You cannot get colder than absolute zero where the only motions are quantum in nature Because there is an absolute zero and the extraction of work via the use of heat dierences as in the Carnot cycle requires dumping heat from a hotter to a colder reservoir such work cycles require an ever colder sink and are bound to arrest at absolute zero So more or less follows the dreaded heat death of the universeOn the other hand as we have just seen the universe is vastly nonergodic at levels of complexity of complex organic molecules upward to autonomous agents coevolving with one another and beyond There appears to be no upper bound on this complexitythere is no obvious upper bound that limits this sink as absolute zero limits work cycles in heat engines So it may begin to be worth raising the question whether the universe can expand into an adjacent possible for vastly longer periods than the current lifetime of the universe becoming evermore kinetically trapped thus evermore specific and more refinely dierentiatedFormalizing the Adjacent PossibleIt is helpful to attempt to formalize the concept of the adjacent possible I will do so using classical physics and the now familiar concept of a Ndimensional phase space Recall that our particles in the liter box had three positional variables and three momenta or velocity variables hence six numbers per particle For an N particle system this is the familiar Ndimensional phase spaceLets just go ahead and define the classical Ndimensional phase space for a region of real space including the sphere centered on the Earth out to twice the orbit of the moon and containing the positions and momenta of all particles from the Earth out to twice the orbit of the moon Physicists always assure us that this makes sense As usual we can break this classical Ndimensional phase space into a very large number of tiny cells each also Ndimensional At any moment the Earthcentered N system call it the Earth system is in one of these tiny cells or microstates Over time the Earth systemor a larger one including the entire solar system or our galaxy or the local cluster of galaxiesflows from microstate to microstate By our arguments above and ignoring gravitya grave mistake in itselfclearly our Earth system has and will flow nonergodically in this phase space for vastly long time periodsNow the total adjacent possible to the current microstate of our Earth system is just the total number of microstates that are adjacent to our current microstate And that number is very large indeed for it is on the order of N Say there are particles in the Earth system a very crude guess then the total number of adjacent possible microstates is about raised to the to the st power In short in principle the next state of our chunk of the universe is drawn from among raised to the to the st power neighboring microstatesNow lets define the real adjacent possible Each point in our current microstate in its classical Ndimensional phase space lies on a specific trajectory that eventually either stays in the current microstate or leaves the current microstate to flow to one particular adjacent microstate Consider all the points in the current microstate and for each draw a red arrow to the neighboring microstate into which that point flows Then the real adjacent possible is the collection of all neighboring microstates reached by all the red arrows leaving our current microstateThis is a perfectly fine definition in classical physics The real adjacent possible from the current microstate might be a single adjacent microstate into which all arrows flow That would mean that all the points in the current microstate lie on trajectories flowing to the same adjacent microstateOr the real adjacent possible might be the case that arrows flow from the current microstate to two adjacent microstates That would mean that the points in the current microstate can be partitioned into two classes perhaps lying in distinct regions of the current microstate One class of points flows to one of the adjacent microstates the other class flows along trajectories to the other adjacent microstate But the implication of the existence of two classes of points in our microstate is that its symmetry is brokenthe space is broken into two regions each of which may be compact or be intermixed and intertwined volumes One volume flows to one adjacent possible microstate the other flows to the other adjacent microstateMore generally we can define the dimensionality of the real adjacent possible with respect to any microstate in the Earth system as the number of adjacent microstates into which flow occurs from somewhere within the current microstate The dimensionality of the adjacent possible from a given microstate might be as low as or as large as the mathematical number of adjacent microstates raised to the raised to the st powerClearly the larger the dimension of the adjacent possible the more symmetries have been broken within the current microstate for it is broken into at least as many volumes internally as the dimensionality of the adjacent possible from that microstate Of course in the case of a classical deterministic Ndimensional phase space the Earth system flows from its current microstate to only one of the real adjacent possible microstatesIt is interesting to remark that at some point if the dimensionality of the adjacent possible of a microstate of the Earth system increases enough the volume within a microstate corresponding to flow to a specific adjacent possible microstate will become small enough that it must run up against Heisenbergs uncertainty principle Then at the quantum level the current microstate can have an amplitude to flow to many of the adjacent possible microstates Which way the current microstate flows is then no longer deterministic but a matter of throws of the quantum diceHistorical Expansion into the Adjacent Possible and Hints of a LawLets now ask whether we think that the dimensionality of the adjacent possible of the Earths biosphere has increased or decreased in the past billion years Consider as a start a liter of living bacteria and a liter of their dead homogenized molecular components In the living system small fluctuations in chemical concentrations within cells are turning myriad genes on and o in the complex system of genetic regulatory networks known to exist in bacteriaAn example of a small section of the genetic network is the lactose operon in E coli The lactose operon contains three structural genes that is genes encoding proteins and two nearby small sequences of DNA called a promoter and an operator The promoter and operator act to regulate the transcription of the structural genes into RNA Normally a repressor protein synthesized from a distant gene binds to the operator blocking transcription of the structural genes from the promoter In the presence of lactose however the lactose binds to the repressor protein and changes its configuration such that the repressor leaves the operator freeing it In that condition other proteins bound at the promoter are able to transcribe the structural genes of the lactose operon Included among these is the enzyme betagalactosidase Betagalactosidase metabolizes lactose Thus the cell normally does not make the betagalactosidase enzyme yet in the presence of the metabolite for which that enzyme is required the lactose operon works to turn on synthesis of the very enzyme that metabolizes lactose But the fact that small changes in the internal lactose concentration within E coli turn on synthesis of the lactose operon including the betagalactosidase that metabolizes lactose is precisely the kind of threshold eventthe operon switches on or does not switch onthat constitutes the breaking of symmetries in the current microstate of the liter of living bacteria Mathematically the thresholds become separatrices in the chemical state spaces of the bacteria on one side of which the lactose operon turns on and on the other side of which it does notIn fact the lactose operon system is a bistable switch Once the operon is switched on one of the three structural proteins is a permease that enhances transport of lactose into the cell Thus once the operon is activated it will remain active even if the concentration of lactose outside the cell is lowered from an initial high level required to activate the operon to some intermediate concentration At that intermediate external concentration the cell can be stably in two states lactose operon active or lactose operon inactive Then small fluctuations of internal lactose concentration that cross the internal threshold separatrix concentration can cause the cell to jump from one to the other state of activity and remain in the other state for a relatively long timeFor the liter of living bacteria the number of adjacent possible microstates is on the order of at least the number of dierent ono combinations of activities of genes and metabolic products of which all the genetic regulatory networks of all the cells are capable It seems obvious that the number of real adjacent possible microstates hence the dimensionality of the adjacent possible from the current microstate of the liter of living bacteria is very much larger than the dimensionality of the adjacent possible of the liter of dead and homogenized bacteria at the same temperatureThis simple observation suggests that in the past billion years since life arose and autonomous agents began coconstructing a biosphere linking exergonic and endergonic reactions into a diversifying web of ways of making a living as the molecular diversity species diversity and behavioral diversity has increased the dimensionality of the adjacent possible of the biosphere as a whole and most typical chunks of it has increased dramaticallyWith respect to my comment above about the broken symmetries eventually hitting the Heisenberg uncertainty limit on the volumes in each microstate it is probably of more than passing interest that real living entities cells do straddle the classical and quantum boundary One photon hitting a visual pigment molecule can beget a neural response In short real living systems straddle the quantum classical boundary If there is a tendency of coevolving autonomous agents to increase the diversity of alternative events that can occur then living entities must eventually hit the Heisenberg uncertainty limit and abide at least partially in the quantum realmIndeed the hypothesis that living entities must eventually abut and even transgress the Heisenberg uncertainty limit and abide partially in the quantum realm leads to an intriguing hypothesis In chapter we will consider quantum decoherence This is a quite wellestablished phenomenon in which the quantum amplitudes propagating along dierent possible pathways between the same initial and final state can lose phase information This loss of phase information then prevents the constructive and destructive interference that is the hallmark of quantum phenomena The loss of the capacity for interference would mark the transition to classical behavior Many physicists now think that such decoherence constitutes a modern interpretation of the famous collapse of the wave function during a measurement event as posited by the Copenhagen school The collapse of the wave function converts the propagating superposition of quantum possibilities into an actual classical eventThe persistent intermingling of quantum and classical phenomena in a living cell might require quantum coherence but that coherence is widely doubted at the normal temperatures of cells and organisms On the other hand persistent intermingling of quantum and classical phenomena might well occur and not require quantum coherence if the timescale of decoherence is close to or overlaps the timescales of cellularmolecular phenomena Recent calculations suggest that the timescale of decoherence of a protein in water at room temperature might be on the order of seconds Thus it is interesting that proteins and other organic molecules have modes of motion on timescales over many orders of magnitude spanning from tens of seconds down to second or less Thus the timescale of decoherence is almost the same as the rapid molecular motions in cells It does not seem totally implausible that cells persistently abide in both the quantum and classical realms in which the persistently propagating superposition of amplitudes for alternative molecular motions decohere on very rapid timescales and thereby help choose the now classical microstates of proteins and their motions as those proteins couple their coordinated dance with one another to carry out the alternative behaviors that guide a cell in its next set of actions its adjacent possible In short cells may feel their way into the adjacent possible by quantum superpositions of many simultaneous quantum possibilities which decohere to generate specific classical choices Such a hypothesis should be testableMore at the high risk of saying something that might be related to the subject of consciousness the persistent decoherence of persistently propagating superpositions of quantum possibility amplitudes such that the decoherent alternative becomes actualized as the now classical choice does have at least the feel of mind acting on matter Perhaps cells prehend their adjacent possible quantum mechanically decohere and act classically Perhaps there is an internal perspective from which cells know their worldHaving now defined the dimensionality of the adjacent possible and noted that the biosphere and universe as a whole is vastly nonergodic hence kinetically trapped in a small region of its total space of possibilities it is fair to wonder whether general laws may govern this nonergodic flow Given that the dimensionality of the adjacent possible of the biosphere has expanded in the past billion years I want to make the obvious conjecture at a law Our biosphere and any biosphere expands the dimensionality of its adjacent possible on average as rapidly as it canI will return just below to think about bounds on this expansion For as we will see it seems reasonable that if the expansion were too rapid the system would destroy the propagating organization of autonomous agents whose coevolution and increasing diversity is what drives expansion into the adjacent possible and tends secularly to increase that dimensionality Autonomous agents persistently stumble onto new ways of making a living with one another and exploit those new ways The biospheres advance into the adjacent possible is just exaptation over and over againIn fact it seems reasonable to think of the workspace of the biosphere that is what can happen next as its actual plus its real adjacent possible It seems likely and I do conjecture that the biosphere is expanding its workspace on average as fast as it can do so without destroying itself in the processAnd brazen biologist that I am I begin to wonder whether the universe as a whole in its nonergodic flow might be expanding the dimensionality of its total workspace including its adjacent possible as a secular trend If so then since the big bang the universe persistently diversifies and becomes more complex in such a way that the diversity of dierent possible next events keeps increasing as rapidly on average as is possible The greater the current diversity of matter processes and sources of energy the more ways there are for these to couple to generate yet further novelty further symmetry breakings For this to be correct time would have to have a directionality toward persistently broken symmetries And an arrow of time would lie in this directionality In chapter I return to these issues There may be grounds to understand why the universe is so complex In a generalization of our image of a selfconstructing biosphere the universe may construct itself to be as complex and diverse as possibleIf one could ever show such a law a law in which the diversity and complexity of the universe naturally increases in some optimal manner that would be impressive Some fourth law of thermodynamics An arrow of time In short one intriguing hypothesis about the arrow of time is that the nonergodic universe as a whole constructs itself persistently into an expanding adjacent possible persistently expanding its workspace This is in sharp contrast to the familiar idea that the persistent increase in entropy of the second law of thermodynamics is the cause of the arrow of time But the second law only makes sense for systems and timescales for which the ergodic hypothesis holds The ergodic hypothesis does not seem to hold for the present universe and its rough timescale at levels of complexity of molecular species and above Perhaps we are missing something big right in front of usThe nonergodicity of the universe as a whole and the biosphere in particular is interesting from another point of view History enters when the space of the possible that might have been explored is larger or vastly larger than what has actually occurred Precisely because the actual of the biosphere is so tiny compared to what might have occurred in the past billion years and because autonomous agents can evolve by heritable variations that induce propagating frozen accidents in descendant lineages the biosphere is profoundly contingent upon historyBounds on the Growth of the Biospheres Adjacent PossibleThe first point to discuss about critical limits to the growth of the dimensionality of the adjacent possible is that major extinction events have occurred Presumably the molecular diversity and certainly the species and behavioral diversity of the biosphere were devastated during such events There are two schools of thoughts on these extinctions the catastrophists and the endogenists The catastrophists point to meteors like the monster that hit o the coast of the Yucatan at the end of the dinosaur era presumably but not certainly causing their extinction The endogenists including me admit some big rocks plummeted but note the power law distribution in the size of extinction events with many small ones and few large ones and see in these signs selforganized criticality models discussed in the next chapter in which many small and few large extinction events arise from the endogenous coevolutionary behavior of ecosystemsParticularly if we who favor endogenous dynamics are correct I am precluded from arguing that biospheres endogenously always increase their adjacent possible For I among others predict endogenous biosphere shenanigans among coevolving autonomous agents as the causes of small and giant extinction events If there is any trend to increase the adjacent possible it can only be a secular trend More any such expansion must ultimately be limited on Earth One cannot have fewer than one member per species disporting themselves on in and around this globe Each species member does occupy a hunk of threedimensional space and the planet is only so bigBut I am more concerned with a probable endogenous selfregulation of any advance into the adjacent possible If that advance into the adjacent possible were to take place too rapidly it would tend to destroy the organismic propagating organization that is the expansions foundation and persistent wellspringRecall the concept of a supracritical chemical reaction system Such systems persistently generate molecular novelty As we saw in discussing the originoflife problem at a critical diversity of molecular species and potential catalysts a phase transition occurs in which the catalyzed reactions form a giant connected component Molecular species flow from the founder set actual into a persistently expanding adjacent possibleI am fond of telling the Noahs Vessel experiment hypothetical though it is I ask thereby whether the biosphere is supracritical Take two of every species all hundred million of them male and female normalizing a bit for mass so you have small bits of hippos and elephants per fly Dump them all into a large blender and homogenize the hell out of them breaking all tissue and cell boundaries spilling out the stu of life into a common homogenized liquorThe small molecule diversity in the blender is presumably on the order of billions the protein and polymer diversity is on the order of hundreds of trillions thus Assuming that any pair of molecular species can undergo at least one two substratetwo product reaction the total number of reactions is as noted above the square of the molecular diversity so is about If the probability that any one protein species catalyzes any one reaction is say one in a trillion or then the expected number of catalyzed reactions is just the product of the number of reactions times the number of potential protein catalysts divided by the probability that a given protein catalyzes a given reaction This yields reactions times proteins divided by which equals In short virtually all possible reactions will be catalyzed by something Indeed on average each possible reaction will find dierent protein catalysts A vast sustained explosion into the adjacent possible would occur Ergo the biosphere is supracritical More precisely the biosphere would be supracritical if all molecular species could be in eective contact with one another on short timescales But all molecular species do not come in contact with one another willynilly for molecular species are packaged into cellsIt is critical to note that individual cells are not supracritical The crude argument says that a cells metabolism has about organic molecules Consider squirting a novel molecule Q into a cell Presumably Q can be one member of two substrates with each of these organic molecules Thus addition of Q to the cell aords about novel reactions Let the protein diversity of the cell be bounded by the human number of genes at Any such protein has evolved for some tasks but may contain molecular nooks and crannies that can serve as novel catalytic sites The expected number of novel catalyzed reactions due to the presence of Q is given by the product of the number of potential protein catalysts times the number of novel reactions made available by injection of Q into the cell divided by the probability that any protein catalyzes any given reaction The product of potential catalysts the proteins and the reactions is or The best current guess at the probability that a randomly chosen protein catalyzes a randomly chosen reaction comes from the probability that a monoclonal antibody canalyzes a reaction and as discussed above is about one in a billion If so the expected number of the novel reactions that will be catalyzed when Q is squirted into a cell is divided by or Since is less than on average no chains of novel reactions are catalyzed and cells are subcriticalIf the probability of catalysis is one only in a trillion as used in the calculation to see if the biosphere as a whole is supracritical rather than one in a billion then cells are even more deeply subcritical With catalysis only one in a trillion the expected number of catalyzed reactions in a cell upon addition of Q is So cells are subcritical It is a very good thing indeed that cells are subcritical If cells were supracritical they would forever generate molecular diversity internal to themselves Many of the novel molecular species would poison the cell In short cells must remain subcritical and cells in communities must remain subcritical or else the rate of generation of molecular diversity would overwhelm the capacity of natural selection to winnow out the winners from the losers Everything would die All propagating organization in the biosphere would rip itself apart in a torrential if brief burst of molecular creativityIn short the adjacent possible would explode rapidly but everything around would bite the dust If cells were supracritical propagating organization would poison its own propagationThe fact that cells almost certainly are not supracritical and that the biosphere as a homogenized whole via the Noahs Vessel experiment clearly is supracritical means that the fact that each cell is somewhat isolated from the other and that each has bounded molecular diversity is not an accident Were it not so we would not be hereBut what of a microbial community Consider such a community with N species As the diversity of species increases the total molecular diversity of the community increases At some point the community as a whole might become chemically supracritical A novel molecular species Q introduced into one species would be sequestered leave the cell unchanged and be taken up by other cells or lost in the soil or undergo a reaction to form a known or a novel species At some diversity of speciesN and some rich onslaught of novel molecular species Q R S the community will become supracritical At that stage molecular diversity in the community increases rapidly If concentrations of novel molecular species are high enough say nanomolar or picomolar then some of the N species will be poisoned The species diversity of the local community will fall Presumably this process can suce such that the diversity of a causally connected local community falls suciently low that the community is not supracriticalThe inverse argument allows the diversity of the community to increase by immigration or mutation of current members This suggests a possible tendency of local communities to move toward the subcriticalsupracritical boundaryIn short an endogenous process almost certainly limits the rate of generation of molecular diversity such that cells and local communities are not supracritical The rate of generation of molecular novelty must be suciently slow that natural selection can work on heritable variants to pick winners from losers The point I am making is that it seems reasonable that endogenous processes in local communities gate the rate of exploration of the molecular adjacent possible keeping it slow enough that natural selection can persistently pick current winners from losers If so the biosphere gates its own rate of entry into the molecular adjacent possible On these arguments the biosphere may advance into the adjacent possible as fast as it can get away with doing soIndeed it is helpful to frame the current discussion as a generalization of a famous phase transition discussed by Manfred Eigen and Peter Schuster called the error catastrophe Eigen and Schuster were considering a population of replicators say viruses or bacteria evolving on a fitness landscape with many peaks of high fitness valleys of low fitness and ridges In general if the mutation rate is low enough a population located at one point on the landscape will have a few mutants one or two of which are fitter These will replicate faster than the less fit cousins eventually replacing them so the population as a whole will move to the new point of higher fitness on the landscape If the process is continued the population will climb steadfastly uphill to a local fitness peak and remain in its vicinityBut if the mutation rate is then gradually increased at some point the population melts o the fitness peak and wanders away across the fitness landscape This melting is the error catastrophe phase transition Eigen and Schuster elegantly relate the known mutation rates of viruses to the sizes of their genomes and show that viruses are close to but below the error threshold where selection can still overcome the melting Bacteria which are metabolically far more complex that viruses are even more conservative than viruses their mutation rate is well below the error catastrophe It is not known why bacteria and higher cells have a mutation rate so far below the error catastrophe Perhaps were the mutation rate of bacteria higher their communities would become supracritical And that would be lethalThus the bounding of mutation rates and community diversity suggests that cells and communities avoid being supracritical which in turn bounds and gates the entry into the adjacent possible by any local community On the other hand the biosphere as a whole is comprised of many dierent local communities The rate of exploration of the adjacent possible globally must be bounded such that a generalized EigenSchuster error catastrophe melting the population or community away from adequate organization to survive and propagate does not occurAll of this suggests the hypothesis that a biosphere expands into the adjacent possible as a secular trend about as fast as it can get away with such exploration subject to the requirement that selection must on average be strong enough and fast enough to slightly more than oset the rate of exploration of noveltyIt is interesting that the same feature may occur in the economy as a whole We hear of future shock Roughly what we fear is that the rate of technological change will overwhelm us But will it Or is there a selfregulating mechanism that gates our rate of entry into the technological adjacent possibleThe latter I think Consider this Why does an innovation get itself introduced Because someone thinks he or she can make money introducing that innovation But if the person or firm making the innovation and introducing it to the global or village markets faced a product life cycle that was so very rapid that neither they nor others in the economy could absorb the innovations and make livings the firms in question would go broke We will only broach the technological adjacent possible at that rate at which we can make a living doing so We gate our entry into the technological futureThus it appears that the biosphere and the econosphere have endogenous mechanisms that gate the exploration of the adjacent possible such that on average such explorations do successfully find new ways of making a living new natural and business games at a rate that can be selected by natural selection or its economic analogue of success or failure at a rate that is sustainable It is a further plausible hypothesis that the rate of exploration of the adjacent possible endogenously converges to the rate that is maximally sustainableI close this chapter with a surprising calculation and conjecture by Harold Morowitz a biophysicist at George Mason University Morowitz considers the atoms that form organic molecules C H N O P S carbon hydrogen nitrogen oxygen phosphorus and sulphur He then considers molecules of these elements and the kinds of bonds that can form between the elements There are two kinds of bonds chainterminating bonds like a terminal hydroxyl group OH and chainextending bonds like CC Chainextending bonds will tend to make a molecular system with many kinds of molecules even more diverse Chainterminating bonds will tend to limit the diversity of molecular species that can formMorowitz then considers the equilibrium ratio of chainextending bonds to all bonds chainextending plus chainterminating that would occur as a function of temperature or equivalently the energy per unit volume of the system At very high temperatures the system is a plasma and chainterminating bonds are vastly more predominant at equilibrium than chainextending bonds At very low temperatures chainterminating bonds predominate overwhelminglyIf one plots the equilibrium ratio of chainextending bonds to all bonds as a function of temperature or energy per unit volume the curve goes up reaches a single peak then trends downward Thus there is an optimal temperature or energy per unit volume where the equilibrium ratio of bonds maximizes the ratio of chainextending chemical bonds to all bonds Morowitzs remarkable conclusion is that the maximum of this curve where chainextending bonds are as abundant as possible at equilibrium corresponds quite closely to the average energy per unit volume of the biosphere of the EarthEven if the calculation is crude I find this result deeply interesting It suggests that somehow the biosphere has achieved an energy per unit volume such that at equilibrium chainextending bonds are maximized But this means that the energy requirements to form a biosphere of high molecular diversity are minimizedIt is as if the biosphere has managed to get itself to an energy per unit volume that permits the maximum expansion of molecular diversity and thus the maximum expansion of the workspace of the biosphere How might that happen We can consider the plausible versions of the Gaia hypothesis in which a simple model planet has black or white daisies The relative abundances of these tunes the albedo or reflective power of the planet hence the fraction of solar energy absorbed by the biosphere Simple models show that the ratio of black and white daisies can evolve to maximize their joint fitness thereby tuning the energy per unit volume of the biosphereMorowitzs calculation should be taken cautiously My conclusions based on his almost backoftheenvelope calculation should be taken even more cautiously The arguments are cogent but unestablished On the other hand the biosphere has exploded in molecular diversity the workspace of the biosphere has expanded the adjacent possible of the biosphere has expanded It is certainly interesting if the energy per unit volume of the biosphere is roughly that which makes this expansion as energetically inexpensive as possible for the autonomous agents coevolving with one another exapting to new forms of making a living playing natural games as we coconstruct our biosphereIn summary I hold out the very interesting conjecture that the biosphere as a whole evolves as a secular trend to expand its workspace including the dimensionality of the adjacent possible as fast as is sustainably possible If so we have broached a tentative law for any biosphere In the next chapter I discuss three further candidate laws Treat all of them with great caution It is enough if at this stage we can even begin to formulate tentative laws for all biospheres A general biology is hardly begun let alone explored Chapter Candidate Laws for the Coconstruction of a Biosphereor the purpose of our discussion here grant that molecular autonomous agents propagate organization and evolve by the roughly familiar Darwinian aegis of mutation and selection These agentscoevolving with one another discovering displacements from equilibrium that can be used to accomplish work making records of such sources of energy then linking those exergonic reactions to endergonic reactionsare the means by which our biosphere has come into being actually coconstructed by the activities accidents striving and failures of these autonomous agents exapting persistently into their adjacent possibleYes But how does a biosphere get itself constructed Are there laws Are there laws that might hold for any biosphere Laws of a general biology wherever autonomous agents swirl into existence and change forever the begetting of the universeNo one knows Yet is seems reasonable to expect such laws and honorable to begin even now to seek them At worst we will be wrong Rather more stunningly we may be right It is surely enough if at this early state we can even begin to formulate candidate general laws Our eorts will only improve over timeIn the present chapter I consider four candidate general laws for any biosphere Because the science is more advanced than some of the material in the previous chapters I will be able to describe it in somewhat more detail That which is more worked out is I hope a signature of how the glimmered science of the past seven chapters may developCoevolutionarily constructible communities of molecular autonomous agents may evolve to four apparently dierent phase transitionsLaw Communities of autonomous agents will evolve to the dynamical edge of chaos within and between members of the community thereby simultaneously achieving an optimal coarse graining of each agents world that maximizes the capacity of each agent to discriminate and act without trembling handsLaw A coassembling community of agents on a short timescale with respect to coevolution will assemble to a selforganized critical state with some maximum number of species per community In the vicinity of that maximum a power law distribution of avalanches of local extinction events will occur As the maximum is approached the net rate of entry of new species slows then haltsLaw On a coevolutionary timescale coevolving autonomous agents as a community attain a selforganized critical state by tuning landscape structure ways of making a living and coupling between landscapes yielding a global power law distribution of extinction and speciation events and a power law distribution of species lifetimesLaw Autonomous agents will evolve such that causally local communities are on a generalized subcriticalsupracritical boundary exhibiting a generalized selforganized critical average for the sustained expansion of the adjacent possible of the eective phase space of the communityCandidate Law The Dynamical Edge of ChaosMolecular autonomous agents for example freeliving cells are parallelprocessing molecular dynamical systems A bacterium such as E coli has on the order of three thousand structural genes The diversity of molecular species in E coli includes perhaps a thousand small molecules in metabolism the genes RNA and protein species lipids large carbohydrates and so forth For the sake of argument lets say there are about five thousand molecular species in E coli Perhaps the number is largerA cell is a parallelprocessing dynamical system That is to say the cell carries out a wide variety of molecular activities including the turning on and o of transcription of genes into RNA the processing of that RNA into mature messenger RNA the translation of that RNA into proteins the activities of many of those proteins as enzymes to catalyze reaction the modification of the activities of enzymes by chemical events such as phosphorylation and dephosphorylation the building of structural components such as bilipid membrane and microtubule assembly and disassembly and the construction of proteins and other receptors These receptors are located transmembrane at the cell boundary and elsewhere in the cell including on nuclear membranes of eukaryotes such that signal molecules can be detected and responded toSo lots of activities are going on all the time in parallel in your typical E coli yeast or your own pancreatic cells The proper conceptual framework to think about all this activity is the state space of the system If we ignore geometry that is the locations of molecules relative to one another in the cellwhich is a big idealizationthen the state space of a cell consists of a list of all the molecular species and their activities or concentrationsIn the following I will focus on the behavior of the genetic regulatory network It has been known since the seminal work of Jacob and Monod in and work for which they won the Nobel Prize that genes can turn one another on and o In more detail the protein made by one gene can diuse in the cell and bind to a DNA site called a cis acting site near a second gene Genes that encode proteins are the structural genes the binding of the protein or several proteins at a set of nearby cis sites can turn the second structural gene on or o More generally the binding of diusible factors called trans acting factors to cis sites can tune graded rates of transcription of the nearby structural geneThe human cell is estimated to have about eighty to a hundred thousand structural genes and between ten thousand to perhaps a hundred thousand cis acting sites In general any structural gene may be regulated by zero to ten dierent trans acting factors that may bind at one or more nearby cis acting sites Therefore the human genomic system is a highly complex web of regulatory connections and interactions by which the activities of genes turn one another on and o or more generally tune one anothers activityIt is the joint dynamical behavior of such genetic networks plus the remaining cellular network of proteins and other molecular interactions that controls cell behavior including development from the fertilized egg to the adultIn the past three decades considerable theoretical insight has been achieved with respect to the expected behaviors of such large genetic regulatory networks I discuss the relations to experimental evidence briefly belowBoolean NetworksTo take a very simple case we consider the N genes of a cell and idealize further to imagine that at any moment in time a gene is either actively transcribing into RNA with active or it is not transcribing so is inactive hence Thus the genes are treated as binary or Boolean variables A Boolean network is a model genetic network with N binary or Boolean genes each receiving regulatory inputs from some among the N genes and each governed by a Boolean function on its inputs telling the activities of its inputs for which it should turn on or oThe Boolean idealization is severe but it is a very useful place to start If the human genome has structural genes and each can be on or o then the number of possible patterns or states of gene activity in the human genome is a staggering or about That is a human cell could in principle be in any one of a states of gene activity Its state space is There has only been seconds since the big bang If it took merely a second to turn a gene on or o then no human cell could have explored more than an infinitesimally tiny fraction of its state space even if it had been chugging along since the big bangThat cannot be what cells do Something must confine their flow in their state space And indeed what confines their flow is precisely the genetic regulatory network by which genes turn one another on and oVery good work shows that such networks can exist in three broad regimes an ordered regime a chaotic regime and near a phase transition between order and chaos All the evidence suggests that cells have evolved to lie in the ordered regime fairly near the edge of chaos Communities of cells may lie even closer to the edge of chaos The hypothesis that cells and communities of cells lie in the ordered regime near the phase transition to chaos is candidate law To understand this candidate law I need to describe to you the structure and behaviors of model genetic networks Thereby we can characterize the ordered chaotic and edgeofchaos regimesTo take a very simple case we consider a cell with three genes A B and C In this simplest Boolean idealization there are three genes each of which can be on or o hence there are two raised to the third or eight possible states of gene activities where the ordering of the three symbols stands for the activity states of ABC respectivelyThe most general description of a dynamical system consists in specifying its state space then identifying for each state which state or states it changes into For a deterministic dynamical system each state changes into a unique successor state For a nondeterministic system single states can change to two or more successor states Which of the successor states is chosen in the nondeterministic system is given by some random process such as flipping a coinFigure a shows an arbitrary deterministic state space among the eight states of three genes A B C For each state I have chosen its successor state at randomFigure a shows several characteristic features of these very simple Boolean dynamical systems First note that the system is parallel processing More than a single gene changes its activity value from to or to on many of the state transitions Next there is a finite number of states here eight Each state has a unique successor Over time if the system is released from any initial state it will follow a trajectory of states through state space Since there is a finite number of states eventually the trajectory must hit a state previously encountered on the trajectory But the system is deterministic thus once the trajectory reenters a state previously encountered it will follow a recurrent loop of states in state space called a state cycleIn general the length of a state cycle can be a single state that reenters itself a steady state or all of the states in the state space may lie on a single long cycle that traverses all the states of the state space or state cycles may be any length between these two limitsA second typical property of such a parallelprocessing Boolean system is that more than one state cycle may exist In the present example three state cycles exist in the state spaceState cycles are called attractors because they typically attract the flow of other states into themselves This is shown in the first state cycle where the states and flow into the state cycle but are not on it These two states are called transients Transient states are encountered on trajectories flowing to state cycle attractors but are not encountered again once the attractor is reached assuming no perturbations occur to the systemThe set of states flowing into a state cycle attractor plus that state cycle is called the basin of attraction of the attractorThe set of attractors are jointly the asymptotic longterm alternative behaviors of the network If released from any initial state the system ultimately winds up cycling on one of its attractorsThus in discretevalued deterministic networkshere binary oneseach state lies in a single basin of attraction so the basins of attraction partition the state space into disjoint sets of statesThe simple example of Figure b allows us to show another feature of such synchronous Boolean networkshere synchronous means that all the binary variables change value at the same clocked moment Since each state has a unique successor state we can write a table of all the states and for each its unique successorFigure b shows the state transitions for each state at time T to the state it transforms to one clocked moment later at time T But Figure b also shows for each gene in order ABC the Boolean rule or Boolean function of the three genes A B C that turns each on and o as a function of the values of itself and the other two genesAs it happens genes A and B have Boolean functions that depend on all three genes A B and C By examination however gene C has a Boolean function that depends only on genes A and C not on gene B To say that the activity of gene C depends only on A and C and not B means that once the combinations of activities of A and C are defined at a moment T the next activity of C at T is independent of whether B is on or o at time T Indeed the Boolean function is C not A or not C that is gene C will turn on at the next moment if at the current moment either A is not active or C is not active or both are not activeFrom Figure c after simplifying Boolean expressions as we just did for gene C we can write down the wiring diagram of inputs among the three genes Since A and B depend upon all three genes each receives a regulatory input from all three genes Gene C however receives inputs only from itself and gene AThe combination of Figures d and c respectively shows for each gene the inputs to that gene and the logical or Boolean function by which it turns on and o Thus the combination of c and d is the genetic network among the genesOrder Chaos and the Edge of ChaosAs noted above thirty years of work by many scientistsinitially on synchronous Boolean networks but now generalized to a wider family of model genetic systems including some where genes can exhibit continuously graded levels of activity as their inputs turn gradually up or downall show the same simple general results There are three broad regimes of behavior A number of very simple properties of networks involving connectivity of the network and simple biases on the Boolean functions control which regime a network lies inThe Ordered RegimeFigure shows a hypothetical movie of a network in the ordered regime Let the network be released from an arbitrary initial state and flow along a trajectory toward a state cycle attractor If a gene is rapidly turning on and o or twinkling call it green If the gene is frozen in the active or frozen in the inactive value for a long time say fifty state transitions or more call it red In particular once the system is on its state cycle the twinkling genes that turn on and o on the state cycle would be green and those genes frozen on or frozen o redInitially just after release from some random initial state most genes are twinkling hence green As the network approaches its state cycle more and more genes turn red hence are frozen on or frozen o By the time the system has reached its state cycle attractor the majority of the genes are colored red Figure aMost critically if one considers the subset of red genes they form a giant percolating cluster whose size scales linearly with the size of the entire network In eect the frozen red component is a frozen red sea which spans the entire network and typically leaves behind isolated twinkling green islandsThe Chaotic RegimeIn the chaotic regime the same movie shows that the majority of the genes remain green twinkling on and o Figure c So a vast twinkling green sea spans the network typically leaving behind isolated frozen red islandsThe Edge of ChaosAs parameters of the network discussed below are tuned from the chaotic regime toward the ordered regime the green percolating sea becomes smaller and eventually fragments into two or many isolated green islands The point of fragmentation of the green sea into green islands constitutes a phase transition from the chaotic to the ordered regime This phase transition is sometimes called the edge of chaos Figure bSeveral critical features distinguish the ordered from the chaotic regime In the ordered regime the lengths of state cycle attractors scales polynomially with the number of genes Remarkably in the ordered regime near the phase transition to chaos there is evidence for universal scaling in which the number of states on a state cycle scales as the square root of the number of genes This scaling which I first discovered over thirty years ago still staggers me If the human genome has genes it has a state space of or states Yet if the human genomic system lies in the ordered regime near the phase transition to chaos it will settle down and cycle among the square root of or about statesNow states is very very small compared to The overwhelming order of the ordered regime I believe keeps cells from wandering all over their state spaces for eternities beyond eternities In fact it takes about one to ten minutes to turn a eukaryotic gene on or o so it would take a cell from to minutes or from about hours to about hours to traverse its state cycle attractor This is right in the biological ballpark For example the cell division cycle of dierent human cell types is in the range of to hoursBy contrast in the chaotic regime state cycle lengths scale exponentially with the size of the network The deepest one can go into the chaotic regime is to assign at random the successor state for each state In that case in general each gene is a Boolean function of all N genes In this case the typical state cycle length is the square root of the number of states in the state space For the human genome with states a typical state cycle length would be the square root hence Remember it is only seconds since the big bang State cycle attractors of lengths Not in my body thank you very muchIn the first two articles I wrote on the subject of random Boolean nets as long ago as and I plotted cell cycle lengths from organisms as diverse as bacteria yeast worms plants and simple and complex animals These progressively more complex organisms have progressively more DNA per cell and more genes per cell If the Boolean net theory is on the right track and if cell cycles are a reasonable proxy for expected state cycle times as a function of the number of genes then cell cycle time should scale as a square root function of the number of genes This prediction is actually pretty much correct Indeed a plot of median cell cycle time versus total DNA per cell is a square root function from bacteria to human cellsBut there are caveats The number of genes in cells may not be proportional to the amount of DNA per cell Some DNA is junk A plausible estimate of the number of genes per cell is now available for many organisms On this basis cell cycle time scales somewhere between a square root and a linearthat is directly proportionalfunction of estimated genes per cell So without yet invoking natural selection to tune the structure and logic the theory of random Boolean nets is already quite close to the dataA second critical feature that distinguishes the ordered from the chaotic regime is what happens when the activity of a single gene is transiently reversed I would note that such transient reversals happen all the time in normal development For example a single hormone enters a cell then the nucleus then binds to a nuclear genetic site and transiently changes the activity of some gene Typically the results unleash a cascade of alterations of gene activities These cascades of alterations guide development and cell dierentiation In the ordered regime these cascades tend to be smallish In the chaotic regime the cascades are typically huge In real cells the cascades tend to be smallish More we can actually predict their size distributionLets define a gene as damaged if after an initial gene has had its activity reversed for a single moment the gene in question ever behaves dierently than it would have had the perturbed gene been left undisturbed In eect damage shows that perturbation of a gene aects the behavior of the damaged gene Imagine damaged genes purple If a gene has misbehaved once it is purple whether it stops misbehaving or keeps misbehavingGiven this definition of damage we can consider in detail two identical copies of a network in the same state running at the same speed Now pick a model gene at random If it is on flip it o It is o flip it on Color it purple since you have damaged itNow watch the unperturbed and perturbed copies of the network and consider purple any gene that ever does something dierent in the perturbed network compared to the unperturbed network In general you will see a purple avalanche spread out from the initially perturbed gene The purple avalanche will spread out in some way then must eventually stop For example at a maximum all the genes turn purple Thus we can define the size of a given damage avalanche as the number of genes that turned purple hence misbehaved at least onceIn the ordered regime something magic happens If one of the frozen red genes is perturbed typically no avalanche spreads from that purple gene If an avalanche spreads at all it is tinyBy contrast if a twinkling green gene in one of the isolated green islands is perturbed and turned purple a purple avalanche spreads to some or all of the twinkling green genes in that island But the avalanche stops at the boundaries of the green island since damage avalanches cannot propagate through the frozen red percolating seaBecause purple avalanches cannot propagate through the frozen red percolating sea the green islands are functionally isolated from one another The consequence is that there is a characteristic size distribution of avalanches in the ordered regime and a very dierent distribution in the chaotic regimeFigure a schematizes the distribution of avalanches for networks in the ordered regime very near the phase transition to chaos The figure plots the logarithm of the size of the avalanche on the xaxis and the logarithm of the number of instances of avalanches of each size on the yaxis As you can see the size distribution shows up as a straight line in this log log plot sloping down to the right Hence the distribution is a power law distribution with many small and few large avalanches of change propagating through the network In addition there is a finite cuto and thus a largestsize avalanche which seems to scale as a square root function of the total number of genes in the network Deeper in the ordered regime the size distribution of avalanches remains a power law but the slope down to the right becomes steeper so there are fewer big avalanches compared to small avalanchesIf a human genome is in the ordered regime near the phase transition to chaos and harbors some genes then the largest avalanches should be about two times the square root of the number of genes hence x or about genes This is probably about right In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster with about genes the largest avalanches should be about twice the square root of or x or The largest avalanche I am aware of occurs when the moulting hormone ecdysone acts on the salivary glands and induces changes in about of the pus in the polytene chromosomes If each pu is a single gene as most geneticists think then ecdysone unleashes an avalanche altering the activities of genesNo comparative data yet show whether the size distribution of avalanches in real organisms is a power law nor whether the largest avalanches scale as a square root function of the number of genes in the organism But these hypotheses are fully testable using todays experimental techniquesNevertheless these predictions do roughly fit ones expectation as a biologist Most genes if perturbed should unleash no avalanches or just small avalanches fewer genes should unleash larger avalanches and some modest fraction of the genes at most should be open to alteration by transient alteration in the activity of any single gene Thus this typical or generic behavior of parallelprocessing networks in the ordered regime closely fits the known data and our informed intuitionsThe chaotic regime contrasts starkly with the ordered regime Its expected behaviors are not biologically plausible The chaotic regime diers from the ordered regime for a simple reason In the chaotic regime the twinkling green sea percolates If a single green gene is perturbed and turned purple that perturbation usually unleashes a purple avalanche that spreads through much of the percolating green sea Huge damage avalanches are unleashed by single gene perturbationsThese huge avalanches are exactly the signature of the famous butterfly eect seen in the weather where a small initial change can have largescale consequences In short the spreading purple avalanches constitute sensitivity to initial conditions On the other hand it is important to distinguish between lowdimensional chaos characterized by three or four variables governed by three or four equations and the highdimensional chaos shown in largemodel genetic networks with tens of thousands of gene variables In highdimensional networks of genes modeled as binary variables chaos shows up as the enormous avalanches of damage that spread from one to many of the variables of the model networkFigure b schematizes the size distribution of avalanches in the chaotic regime Unlike the ordered regime there is a spike of huge avalanches where to percent of the genes are damaged In a cell this would correspond to a hormone changing the activity of a single gene and to genes downstream changing their activities This does not happenAs in the ordered regime however in the chaotic regime there is also a power law distribution of small avalanches present in addition to the vast avalanches that rocket through the green sea Presumably these small avalanches occur when green genes near the filigreed coasts of red frozen islands are perturbed and the purple avalanche is trapped on the fingers of the red beachesA third feature a convergence versus divergence along flows in state space that characterizes the ordered versus chaotic regime is perhaps the most important to our future discussions In the ordered regime initially nearby states lie on trajectories that tend to converge in state space In the chaotic regime initially nearby states tend to lie on trajectories that diverge in state space At the edge of chaos initially nearby states tend to lie on trajectories that neither converge nor diverge in state spaceThese behaviors are conveniently shown in a recurrence map which I call a Derrida curve since physicist Bernard Derrida of Saclay France first showed it to me In Derrida and Pomeau were also the first to find analytic proof of the ordered and chaotic regimes and the phase transition between themConsider two states of a Boolean network with five genes and the successors to each of those statesstate state state state We can define the Hamming distance between state and state the number of binary variables by which the two states dier Here the Hamming distance is since gene is in state and in state In addition we can define the normalized Hamming distance Dt between these two initial states at time t as the fraction of binary variables by which they dier Hence Dt is Similarly we can define the normalized Hamming distance between the two successor states at time t In the case above Dt Then we can compare Dt and Dt and ask if the initial distance at time T decreased or increased at time T In the current case the initial distance increased from to at the next moment T In short the two initially nearby states diering in the activity of a single gene spread further apart one moment later Indeed this spreading is the first time step of the spreading of a purple avalanche of damageTo characterize Boolean networks with respect to the ordered and chaotic regime it is convenient to take thousands of random pairs of states at dierent initial distances Dt where Dt can vary from to For each pair of initial states run the Boolean network forward one moment discover the two successor states of the two initial states and compute Dt for that pair of initial states Average the Dt values for the thousands of pairs of initial states at each initial distance Dt The typical results are shown in Figure Figure is a recurrence map with Dt shown on the xaxis Dt shown on the yaxis Thus for an initial pair of states at Dt if the successor states have spread apart say to Dt a dot in the xy plane at x y records this event The averaged set of these dots for the thousands of pairs of initial states at all dierent initial distances is the average recurrence map for the networkIn Figure the main diagonal running at a degree angle from the lowerleft corner which corresponds to Dt and Dt shows the condition where Dt Dt If a dot lies on the main diagonal then the distance between the initial states is the same as the distance between the successor states The two initial states lie on trajectories that neither diverge nor converge in state spaceIn the chaotic regime nearby states lie on trajectories that diverge further apart in state space so the recurrence map lies above the main diagonal for small initial distances For large initial distances even networks in the chaotic regime have the property that states tend to lie on trajectories that converge The degree to which the Derrida recurrence curve lies above the main diagonal for small Dt is a measure of how deeply into the chaotic regime the network lies Deep into the chaotic regime nearby states hence small Dt diverge swiftly Thus the recurrence curve is well above the main diagonal for small values of DtBy contrast in the ordered regime as shown in Figure the Derrida recurrence curve is below the main diagonal for small Dt that is initial states that are close lie on trajectories that converge At the phase transition between order and chaos the Derrida recurrence curve begins at Dt tangent to the main diagonal then falls below it as Dt increasesIn summary in the ordered regime nearby states tend to lie on trajectories that converge in state space At the phase transition nearby states tend to lie on trajectories that neither converge nor diverge In the chaotic regime nearby states tend to divergeAs I will shortly discuss below it is plausible to think that autonomous agents and communities of autonomous agents evolve such that they lie in the ordered regime near the phase transition to chaos A major reason for this intuition is that under such circumstances flow in state space is mildly convergent In turn this will allow the autonomous agents to make the maximum number of reliable discriminations and reliable actions hence to play the most sophisticated natural games by which to earn their livingsThe three features that characterize the phase transition between order and chaos seem by good numerical evidence to coincide That is when parameters discussed below are tuned from the chaotic to the ordered regime such that the green sea is just breaking up into green islands simultaneously the Derrida curve changes from the chaotic regime to become tangent with the main diagonal for small values of Dt And at just this point state cycle lengths switch from scaling exponentially to scaling polynomially with the number of genesAt least three simple parameters tune whether networks are in the ordered or chaotic regimes Therefore it is important that evolution can readily tune whether genomic systems lie in the ordered or chaotic regime by tuning any of these three parameters Even more important evolution seems to have done just that and tuned cells into the ordered regime Since cells are our only example of evolved autonomous agents the data support my candidate first law that autonomous agents and communities of autonomous agents will evolve to the ordered regime near the phase transition to chaosThe simplest parameter to tune is the number of inputs K per gene I showed numerically in and Derrida and Pomeau showed analytically in that if K or less networks lie in the ordered regime Derrida and Pomeau showed that K is the edge of chaos phase transition For K greater than networks lie in the chaotic regimeAlready this is worth the excited attention I gave it so long ago For the results show that a network with randomly chosen logic nevertheless behaves with exquisite order Say a network of genes is constructed at random with the simple limitation that each model gene have K inputs but that the wiring diagram be chosen at random and the Boolean function assigned to each gene among the possible Boolean functions of K inputs is also chosen once and for all at random this spaghetti mess of a network with its tangle of wires connecting the genes in some mad scramble will straighten itself outThe system settles down to cycle among about states out of or Order for free I keep saying Selection need not struggle against all odds to achieve cells that behave with overwhelming order That order lies to hand for selections further craftingsThere are two further known parameters that can tune networks from the chaotic to the ordered regime if K is greater than Both are biases on the Boolean functions Remarkably real cells show dramatic evidence of one of these two biases which I call canalyzing Boolean functions I discuss this canalyzing bias secondThe first bias is characterized by a parameter Derrida and colleagues called P Consider in Figure c the Boolean function for gene A It has five values and three values The parameter P is defined as the number of instances of the majority value over the full set of cases Hence P for gene A For gene B the Boolean function has seven values and one value Its P is For gene C there are six values and two values Its P is By definition P for a Boolean function can vary from to when the majority fraction varies from half to all the possible cases Derrida and colleagues showed that in general when K P can be tuned upward from to some critical value Pc where networks pass from the chaotic to the ordered regime The critical value of P as a function of K is shown in Figure a Universal scaling for cycle lengths as a square root function of the number of genes has been established along the phase transition in the PK planeThe second bias in Boolean functions are the canalyzing Boolean functions Consider gene C in Figure c If gene A is gene C will be at the next moment no matter what the activities of gene B or C may be If gene A is gene C may be or at the next moment depending on the prior state of gene C itselfGene C is governed by a canalyzing Boolean function Canalyzing Boolean functions have at least one input with at least one value that suces to guarantee the next state of the regulated gene regardless of the values of all other inputs By inspection if A is now then C is guaranteed to be a moment later So the Boolean function is canalyzing and I call A a canalyzing input to C Note that gene C is also a canalyzing input to gene CLook next at the Boolean function for gene B in Figure c If gene A is then gene B is sure to be the next moment regardless of the activities of B and C So A is a canalyzing input to B But if B is that too assures that B will be at the next moment So B is a canalyzing input to itself And similarly if gene C is gene B is sure to be the next moment Gene B has three canalyzing inputs By contrast gene A in Figure c has no canalyzing input so is not a canalyzing Boolean function No value of A alone B alone or C alone suces to guarantee the next activity of gene AIn general Boolean functions of K inputs may have K canalyzing inputs Numerical evidence shows that for K inputs per gene a sucient bias toward a high fraction of genes with a sucient number of canalyzing inputs drives networks from the chaotic into the ordered regime Figure b shows the phase transition curve in the CK planeBefore turning back to biology it is essential to stress that the results noted above for synchronous Boolean networks extend to asynchronous Boolean networks and more critically extend to a family of model gene networks in which the genes have graded levels of activity This is important because the ono Boolean idealization is quite severe Real genes show graded levels of activities as a function of the concentrations of their trans acting inputs and the bound states of their cis regulatory loci If our results were fragile in that they depended upon the Boolean ono idealization we could not trust them to inform us about real cells Glass and Hill have examined a model with continuously graded levels of gene activity the piecewise linear model and found the same qualitative behaviors In particular the same phase transition occurs as a function of K P and C The striking dierence however is that deep in the ordered regime of the piecewise linear case the genes of the twinkling green islands settle down to steady states that dier on dierent attractors Near the phase transition to chaos the green islands begin to exhibit sustained limit cycle oscillations that become chaotic in the chaotic regimeThus there is now good general evidence that the ordered and chaotic regimes and the phase transition between them are deeply characteristic of some enormous class of parallelprocessing nonlinear dynamical systemsThe BiologyBut what of real cells We have no conclusive evidence yet an abundance of telling hints If I am not yet entirely convinced and if I amas I ambiased I nevertheless become increasingly confident that cells and probably communities of cells do live in the ordered regime near the edge of chaos Not only does the evidence point this way but cells should live near the edge of chaos Why As remarked already the intuition is simple Being autonomous agents cells must as individuals living in communities make the maximum number of reliable discriminations possible and act on them reliably without trembling hands Just inside the edge of chaos seems the ideal placeIntuitively slightly convergent flow in state space allows classification for when two states converge on a single successor state those two states have been classified as equivalent by the network Slightly convergent flow would seem to allow the maximum number of reliable classifications in the face of a noisy environment The convergent flow buers the system against the noise of the environmentAnd what of trembling hands No point making superb discriminations seeing the stag deer drawing your bow aiming the arrow then shooting yourself in the foot Again slightly convergent flow in state space to buer external and internal noise seems idealSo what about cells My colleagues Steven Harris Bruce Sawhill and Andrew Wuensche and I have carried out work over the past several years that has analyzed actual gene regulatory rules for eukaryotic genes drawn from a variety of eukaryotic organismsyeast Drosophila maize mouse and so forth The results show a very strong statistical bias in favor of genes governed disproportionately by canalyzing Boolean functions When we have constructed model networks with the observed bias toward canalyzing functions such networks lie modestly in the ordered regime by the Derrida curve and other criteria noted aboveIt all began at the Santa Fe Institute several years ago Steve Harris a molecular biologist from Texas was visiting I told him about canalyzing functions Never said Steve Seeing my opportunity I replied You have a good genetics library want to read a bunch of papers and analyze the transcription rules of genes with three or four or five known regulatory inputsI didnt think Steve would say yes for the reading of over a hundred papers in the subsequent years and cataloging the detailed results was going to be a substantial taskSure he repliedSome months later Harris called Hey the results for genes with K inputs look interesting There is a bias toward canalyzing functionsNever I saidIll send the data was the replySteve had carefully read about sixty papers on regulated genes with K known inputs where the data was available at the level of actual binding of trans acting factors to cis sites and the turning on of transcription A gene with K known inputs has in the Boolean idealization to the rd or possible ono states of those inputs as we have seen In virtually all the cases used Steve had good data for all eight input states He warranted the Boolean idealization had its problems but found that in many cases the response of a gene was nonlinear to its inputs Thus gene A might be turned on percent by factor and percent by factor but percent by both factors at the same concentration It looks like the Boolean and function where the regulated gene is on at the next moment only if both inputs are on nowWe need some mathematical facts The number of Boolean functions of K inputs is to the to the K K For K there are Boolean functions For K there are Boolean functions For K there are Boolean functions For K there are over a billion Boolean functionsA Boolean function with K inputs as noted can have K canalyzing inputs But as K increases the number of Boolean functions that are canalyzing at all on or more inputs declines dramatically as shown in Figure In particular percent of the Boolean functions of K inputs are canalyzing But only percent of the Boolean functions of K inputs are canalyzing Only percent of the Boolean functions of K inputs are canalyzing Only less than percent of the billion or so Boolean functions of K inputs are canalyzingThis shift means that we can test if there is a bias in sampled eukaryotic genes Indeed in more detail among the K Boolean functions percent have no canalyzing inputs and a decreasing fraction of the Boolean functions have or canalyzing inputs as you can see in Figure Also plotted on Figure is the observed fraction of eukaryotic genes with K inputs The observed curve is the opposite from the curve expected if K genes were regulated by Boolean rules drawn at random from among the functions Indeed fully percent of the observed cases have canalyzing inputs while the expected fraction would be only peercent if rules were drawn at randomOne does not need fancy statistics but they readily confirm that the observed distribution is sharply shifted to large numbers of canalyzing inputs per gene Figure shows similar results for genes with K known inputs Again the shift toward genes regulated with a high number of canalyzing inputs is apparent and strongly statistically significant Data for K and K genes shows the same bias but the cases are too few to be statistically significantBut there remains analysis to be done Recall the P parameter Networks with high P values where genes are mostly turned on or turned o by their inputs also lie in the ordered regime Moreover there is an overlap but nonidentity between the classes of Boolean functions of high P values and Boolean functions with or more canalyzing inputs When we analyzed our samples of genes they also had high P values compared to a random distribution of Boolean functions with K or K inputsIn order to discriminate whether the observed bias was toward high canalyzing inputs or high P values or both we carried out a residual analysis That is we classified all K Boolean functions into dierent P classes P P P P Within each P class some Boolean functions have or canalyzing inputs Therefore among all the Boolean functions for K within a given P class there is some distribution of Boolean functions with or canalyzing inputs Thus we asked within a given P class if the real genes showed a residual bias toward a high number of canalyzing inputs per gene compared to what would happen if real genes were governed by Boolean rules drawn at random with respect to canalization The answer for K and K genes is overwhelmingly yesIn short if we control for P classes there is a very strong and very statistically significant residual bias toward high numbers of canalyzing inputs per gene Conversely when we controlled for canalyzing input classes and tested for a residual bias toward high P values there was no sign whatsoever of such a bias Thus it appears that evolution has in fact tuned the choices of Boolean rules used to govern genes with K and K known inputs as well as genes with K and K inputs that we have sampled sharply in favor of a high bias toward usage of Boolean rules that are canalyzing functionsThe main caveat to hold in mind in addition to misreading the articles or the articles being a nonrandom sample of published data is that genes governed by canalyzing functions may have more easily detected genetic eects hence be noticed and studied Only future work with randomly chosen structural genes will overcome this source of bias Despite the caveat I am quite convinced by the data In particular genes governed by high P values would also have easily detected genetic eects yet there is no such bias in the dataTentatively eukaryotic genes are governed by rules biased toward many canalyzing inputs per gene Why Either chemical simplicity or natural selection or both I thinkNow lets examine the consequences We know that networks with K K or more inputs per gene are generically in the chaotic regime if Boolean functions are chosen randomly from the full range of possible functions of K K or more inputs We have observed a substantial bias toward canalyzing functions Does this bias suce to tune networks with K or K or more genes into the ordered regimeOur group constructed large networks of genes using Wuensches wonderful DDlab program available on line to examine model systems with up to genes When we made networks with K or K inputs and randomly chosen Boolean functions their Derrida curves as expected were in the chaotic regime a percolating green sea existed and vast purple avalanches careened around the systemWhen we made networks with K or K inputs tuned to the exact distribution of fractions of genes with or canalyzing inputs the results Figure a show that such networks are clearly in the ordered regime The Derrida curve is below the main diagonal Therefore in such networks a percolating frozen red sea exists leaving behind isolated green islands and the distribution of purple damage avalanches is a power law with a finite cuto at about times the square root of the number of genes Figure b This last predicts that the largest avalanches of gene changes if any single gene is perturbed in humans should be about genes This fits presently known dataWe even have tentative evidence of detailed evolutionary tuning As the number of inputs per gene increases a gradually decreasing fraction of the Boolean functions must be canalyzing to cross the phase transition into the ordered regime Although the data are too few to warrant conclusion the fraction of canalyzing inputs for K K and K eukaryotic genes trends downward as K increases along the curve needed to remain just within the ordered regime This decrease as K increases results in the virtual identity of the K Data K Data and K Data curves in Figure a If so only natural selection can have tuned it thusThere are other clues reported in Origins of Order and At Home in the Universe in some detail that support the hypothesis that cells lie in the ordered regime This interpretation is based on the assumption that the dierent cell types of a higher eukaryote correspond to the dierent state cycle attractors of the network One attractor is a liver cell another is a kidney cell and so forthThe percolating frozen core that is identical on all attractors of the Boolean network is likely to correspond to the core set of genes whose expression is known to be identical on all cell types commonly thought to be housekeeping genesThe typical dierences in gene activity patterns in model cell type attractors usually a few percent mirror the data for real cellsThe number of state cycle attractors robustly scales as a square root function of the number of genes in the ordered regime The number of cell types in real cells scales as roughly a square root to a linear function of the estimated number of genes in that organism from yeast to sponge to worm to man Indeed the square root of is about and Bruce Alberts and colleagues quote the number of cell types in humans as The expected power law size distribution of avalanches of gene changes after perturbation of a single genes activity seems plausible and fits the still sparse dataModel cell types are homeostatically stable to most small perturbations So are real cell typesIf a state cycle attractor is a cell type then cellular dierentiation from one to another cell type corresponds to a perturbation that causes the cell type to leave one attractor and flow to another attractor In the ordered regime any cell type can only directly reach a few adjacent cell types and may by a succession of perturbations eventually dierentiate along branching developmental pathways to a larger number of cell types Precisely this pattern of branching dierentiation is known in all multicelled organismsThere are other data but perhaps that will suce I believe the initial evidence strongly suggests that eukaryotic cells are in the ordered regime not too far from the phase transition to chaosThis hypothesis which I here tentatively adopt as a candidate general law for any biospherea very long jump to be sureis now open to direct tests Current technology based on Aymetrix chips displays the DNA from thousands of dierent genes in a twodimensional array RNA can be sampled from small tissue fragments or even single cells and via a few steps caused to bind through WatsonCrick base pairing to the corresponding DNA sequence In this way the transcribed RNA abundances of thousands of genes can be sampled simultaneously Thus we can now follow the RNA states of cells over time in normal and diseased states treated and nontreated states and so forth Companies such as Incyte are doing just this and selling the data to the large pharmaceutical companies for analysisBut then we can clone controllable cis sites such as promoters into cells at one or more randomly chosen sites and study the eects of transiently perturbing the activities of one or a few genes Is the Derrida curve below the main diagonal or not Does a power law distribution of avalanches of change erupt or not We can use the data to find the genes in the same isolated green islands for avalanches should be confined to one island and overlap if started at dierent genes in the same island More patterns of gene activities that change will change in correlated ways for genes in the same green island but not for genes in dierent green islandsRemarkably recent evidence suggests just such correlated patterns of gene activity changes John Welsh has analyzed the transcription patterns of almost dierent genes in a specific cell type the human melanocyte from newborn children subjected to the eight possible dierent combinations of three distinct modes of perturbation Welsh could in principle distinguish increases decreases or no change in the abundances of gene transcripts for his nearly genes Of these showed no detectable change about showed changes Given eight treatment regimes the control and the seven other treatments consisting of all combinations of one or more of his three perturbations in principle there are three raised to the seventh power or about possible patterns of response But surprisingly the genes showed only patterns Already this is unexpectedBut the most interesting result is that of the patterns fall into eight mirrorsymmetric pairs Under some conditions one set of genes increases in transcript abundance while a second set of genes decreases in transcript abundance Under other of the seven perturbing conditions the roles are reversed and the first set of genes decreases in transcript abundance while the second set increases in transcript abundance Welsh found eight such mirror symmetric pairs of sets of genes suggesting at least eight dierent coordinated sets of genes each coregulated yet each buered from the other sets of genesIt may be that Welsh has found the first evidence of genes lying in eight dierent green islands buered from one another by the percolating red frozen structure If the green islands exist they are the paragraph structure of the genome They are the midsize decisiontaking subcircuits of the genome For each such island cut o from influence by other islands by the frozen red structure has its own alternative attractors two for this island five for that island seven for a third island The total number of attractors for the entire network is then x x And if so cell types are a kind of combinatorial code of the choices made by the dierent islandsAnd yet more My colleague Marc Ballivet with a minor bit of help from me has come up with a means to rapidly clone most or all cis sites from cells If the thousands of cis sites can be cloned each can be used to anity purify the trans factors binding it Other biologists are learning how to construct small genetic circuits By our means or others the medicine of the twentyfirst century will learn to control the activities of genes in genetic networks hence control tissue regeneration and dierentiation We enter the postgenomic eraI return to my candidate law and remark next that cells typically do not live alone they live in communities of singlecelled organisms or other simple multicellular organisms or they live in tissues in highly complex multicellular organisms Thus any candidate law must be considered with respect to a community of autonomous agentsConsider an ecosystem with dierent species of bacteria Each species may secrete dierent chemical species S that impinge on a subset C of the other cell species In Figure I show a threedimensional coordinate system One axis shows the orderchaos axis for a single isolated bacterium measured by Derrida curve criteria with order on the left near the origin and chaos on the right The remaining axes show C and SIf a given cell is at the phase transition between order and chaos and additional molecular inputs S per cell come from C dierent types of cells the total connectivity in the cell is raised from KN to KN CS The results will typically drive that cell into the chaotic regime Indeed the entire community will be driven into the chaotic regimeHence in the coordinate system of Figure Igor Yakushin at Bios Group has shown that a hyperbolic surface as shown separates the ordered regime from the chaotic regime Cells can buer themselves from chemical perturbations from other species by retreating deeper into the ordered regime This can be accomplished by increasing the number of canalyzing inputs per gene And indeed as described above individual eukaryotic cells do appear to lie well within the ordered regime perhaps as buering for the fact that such cells like yeast live in microbial communities or like human cells live in tissues where each cell is bombarded with chemical signals from other cells in the same bodyIt is a plausible conjecture that communities of cells and tissues come to lie on the phase transition surface between order and chaos The hypothesis is readily tested If so perturbations of a single gene in one type of cell should trigger a power law distribution of avalanches of changes of gene activities that spreads from the perturbed gene to other genes in that cell and species and to cells of other species Further the Derrida curve of the total community should be at the phase transitionA final numerical test is under way The aim of the numerical test is to check whether cells and communities that lie at the phase transition would in fact make the maximum number of reliable discriminations and act without trembling handsCells that are yammering at one another probably never reach their attractors Pick a subset M of the states in each cell in the community as its action states Now release the community numerically somewhere on the edgeofchaos surface Over a long period of time the M action states will be encountered in some order yielding some probability distribution of transitions between pairs of the M states as each cell is perturbed by S chemical signals from C other cell types The transitions among the M action states of each cell can be written in a matrix showing the transition probabilities between any pair of the M states From this it is possible to calculate the mutual information MI between pairs of the M action statesMI is HA HB HAB Here HA is the entropy of A HB the entropy of B and H AB is the joint entropy of A and B If A and B are occurring randomly with respect to one another then HAB equals the sum of HA HB so MI is If either A or B is unchanging MI is again But if A and B are changing in correlated ways MI is positive Hence we can ask what value of M maximizes the mutual information among the M states how is that related to cell and community position on the edgeofchaos phase transition in Figure and how well does the mutual information among the M action states correlate with the mutual information in the patterns of CS input signals arriving at each cell type More broadly can selection maximize both M and that mutual information correlation and if so for what value of M and where on or o the phase transition surface in Figure I do not know the answers but hope the optimal point lies on the phase transition surface for such selected mutual information correlation would begin to show that such communities of cells with such regulatory networks can indeed make the maximum number of reliable discriminations and act on them without trembling hands to make a complex living in a complex worldCandidate Law Community Assembly Reaches a SelfOrganized Critical StateFirst a foray into selforganized criticality a concept that will drive the rest of this chapterPer Bak and his colleagues in published a paper concerned with sand piles One is to take a large flat table supply lots of sand and gently let sand fall from on high onto the table As the sand piles up it eventually reaches the rest angle for sand and also extends to the boundaries of the table You keep adding sand slowly Sandslide avalanches begin to form and sand drops to the floor Measure the size distribution of the avalanches and a power law distribution is revealed with many small avalanches and few large avalanches Figure Power law distributions can in fact arise in many ways One of those ways is at a phase transition for example in a ferromagnet at the phase transition temperature Above the phase transition temperature the magnetic spins line up randomly with one another and keep flipping Below the phase transition temperature the ferromagnet tends to line up with magnetic spins all pointing the same way say north pole upward hence the material is magnetized At the phase transition temperature something magic and universal occur clusters of spins oriented the same way arise and the clusters have a power law distribution of sizes The power law distribution implies that there is no preferred size scale in the system If there were a preferred size scale clusters would be distributed exponentially in size setting a size scale at which clusters at that size were half as likely as tiny clusters of spinsSo too for the sand pile There is no preferred size scale revealed by the power law distribution of sand slide avalanche sizes The big dierence is that clever physicists tuned the temperature of the ferromagnet to the critical phase transition temperature Per and company tuned nothing they merely let sand drop randomly and gently onto the sand pile and the sand pile tuned itself to criticality hence the name selforganized criticalityMany of us have fallen in love with these results Many are critical as well I am on the pro side of the debate I know the theory does not apply to real sand with its rough edges and works well with shortgrain Swedish rice but I love it anyway Newtons law of universal gravitation does not work for bits of paper and cannon balls falling from the Tower of Pisawind resistance you see The bits of paper do not hit the ground at the same time as do the cannon balls Most theories have ceterus paribus clauses But I suspect Per and friends have found a deep truth about how nonequilibrium systems selforganizeThe remaining three of the four candidate laws apply versions of this idea Even law above is a version Selection tunes communities of cells to the phase transition between order and chaos where a power law distribution of damage avalanches on all scales propagate across the systemThe claims coming next are not my own work but derive from fine eorts by ecologists Stuart Pimm Mack Post and more recently Bruce Sawhill and Tim Keitt making use of work by physicist Scott Kirkpatrick and his colleaguesFirst the early work of Stuart Pimm and Mack Post done in the late s They were concerned with community assembly of organisms into a local ecosystem Figure They ignored longterm coevolution and made use of the LotkaVolterra equations These equations basically say for any species what other species it eats how readily it turns the eaten prey into an extra copy of itself and how fast it reproduces on its own without eating Plants herbivores and carnivores are readily representedStuart and Mack did a surprising study with an astonishing and still poorly understood result They made a pile of hypothetical critters in a computer each governed by some plausible LotkaVolterra equation whose parameters were drawn at random from some distribution Then with fond hopes Stuart and Mack randomly chose species one after another and tossed them into the computational equivalent of east Kansas Kansas is a place for people who like subtlety my friend Wes Jackson once told a group of us visiting his Land Institute in Kansas in January We observed subtly dierent shades of brown grass trees dirt dust hawks mice and agreedWhat Stuart and Mack found was this When the first few species were tossed into east Kansas in silico they tested whether these few could coexist by running the corresponding LotkaVolterra equations of all the species simultaneously to see if the hypothetical species all sustained abundances above zero For example the model community might go to a steadystate ratio of four species or might enter a limit cycle oscillation or some chaotic dynamics with a strange attractor that remains above zero for all speciesDandy the mock community was stable They kept adding randomly chosen species At first it was easy to add new species but it became progressively harder until no more species could be added The deep mystery is why It is not a lack of food or energy Furthermore on the way to assembling the community Stuart and Mack began to notice that as the community filled up addition of one species could make one or more other species go locally extinct They began to find evidence of power law distributions of such extinction eventsWhy No one knows for sure and Stuart has some wonderful ideas discussed in his fine book The Balance of Nature But I am going to move on to the recent ideas of Bruce Sawhill and Tim Keitt which build on the work of physicist Scott Kirkpatrick Scott is famous for coinventing the SherringtonKirkpatrick spinglass model and hangs out at IBM being smart Not long ago he took up what is called the Ksat problemHere is the Ksat problem Consider some logical formula or expression as in our Boolean net Any Boolean expression can be cast in normal disjunctive form an example is A or A and A or A and not A or not A In such an expression the variables between brackets constitute a clause so this logical expression has three clauses The clauses are linked by and Thus for the entire statement to be true all three clauses must be true Within each clause variables are linked by the logical or symbolized with v A v A is true if A is true if A is true or if both A and A are trueNow we can ask if the above expression can be satisfied by some assignment of true or false or to the four variables A A A and A The answer is yes since if A true and A true and A false then all clauses are satisfied On the other hand consider A and not A There is no assignment of true or false to A that makes both clauses true since they contradict one another More generally an expression in normal disjunctive form with K variables A v A v Ak in each clause a total of C clauses and a total of V variables A A Av may or may not be satisfiableThe wonderful result that Scott and friends showed is a phase transition from Ksat expressions that are almost certainly satisfiable to Ksat expressions that are almost certainly not satisfiable Figure In Figure the horizontal axis is labeled CV Thus the xaxis shows the ratio of clauses to variables hence on average how many clauses each variable is in Obviously as each variable is in more and more of the C clauses with randomly assigned truth requirements Vi versus notVi the chance that the set of clauses can be jointly satisfied gets harder On the other hand as K goes up there are more variables per clause any one of which if satisfied satisfies the clause since the variables within a clause are joined by or Thus as K goes up the problem gets easierRemarkably there is a phase transition on the CV axis at ln x K or x K As shown in Figure for CV values less than this phase transition value the expression is almost certainly satisfiable As CV passes the x K critical value the probability that the expression can be satisfied plunges to near zeroNow the idea that Bruce and Tim had was that building a community with random critters having random food and niche requirements is like the Ksat problem They consider S species Each species niche includes some of the S species that it eats and some that eat or kill it Thus species S must eat S or S or S to survive but can survive on its own only in the absence of S which poisons the chloroplasts that allow S to be an autotroph In disjunctive form the requirements for species S to survive are S v S v S and not SBruce and Tim did numerical experiments for dierent values of S and K and C where again K is the number of alternative species any given species could eat S v S v S corresponds to K They found the same phase transition As more and more species are added there are more potential interactions among the species since the pairwise possibilities increase as the square of the total species diversity As this occurs each species appears in an increasing number of clauses so as CV increases at some point the satisfiability of the Ksat system went from easy to hard It became hard then impossible to add new species The community filled up because the Ksat problem went from easy to impossibleI find this line of thinking rather interesting Given rather general assumptions on the probability per pair of species of who eats or kills what assigned more or less randomly then as the number of species hence pairs of species increase such communities can fill up in the presence of persistent attempts at invasion Bruce and Tim may have found the underlying reason for Stuart and Macks earlier results Moreover Bruce and Tim have found reasonable numerical evidence for small and large avalanches of local extinction events upon entry of new species while the community was filling upMeanwhile experimental work assembling communities of real organisms shows much the same results Communities tend to fill up and do exhibit small and large local extinction eventsCandidate Law Coevolutionary Tuning of Fitness Landscapes and Organisms to a SelfOrganized Critical StateBegin with a wellstated claim of Darwin gradualism Species evolve argued Darwin by the gradual accumulation of useful variations that were gradually sifted by natural selectionDarwin is correct about contemporary life and presumably about ancient life based on the record In fact for current life forms seven decades of hard work by geneticists working with organisms as disparate as mouse fruit fly maize yeast and many other eukaryotes demonstrates conclusively that most mutations are of minor eect For example the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster upon which I worked for twelve years has the abdominal bristles alluded to above A modest number of mutants exist that slightly increase or slightly decrease the number of abdominal bristles The flies dont seem to mind at least in the odd security of my and other biologists laboratoriesMore rarely there are mutants of rather dramatic eect none more so than the famous homeotic mutants of Drosophila which fascinated me and many others Here a single mutant can change an antenna into a leg or an eye to a wing or a head to the genitalia These survive perfectly well in the laboratory as well but one expects would not fare well in the real worldTherefore most of the heritable variation cast up by mutation is of minor eect and gradual variation is persistent grist for the selection mill Somehow current organisms have contrived themselves to be such that most mutations are of minor eect But is it necessarily the case that all complex systems have the property that most mutations are of minor eect And if not where does the gradualism of Darwinian selection come fromImportantly it is easy to create systems that are not readily adaptable by mutation and selection What follows is not quite a theorem and was discussed in At Home in the Universe but it will do Many of the readers of this book are competent programmers Consider a typical program say written in C Java or some other language Perhaps it computes something as simple as the square roots of the first two million integers Perhaps it simulates an ecosystem Whatever that program does imagine trying to evolve it by making random mutations in the codeWe all know what would happen Most mutations of a computer program are of major eect The program wont compile If it compiles it generates some vast stream of symbolic nonsense or goes into an undetected infinite loop and hangsAnd we can make the matter substantially worse by eliminating redundancy in the code Any computer program can be written as a sequence of binary and symbols where that sequence represents the input data to the program and the program itselfNow a wellknown area of computer science considers how redundant a program is for example a simple redundancy would duplicate each binary symbol Computer scientists talk of eliminating the redundancy of a computer code to achieve the most compressed possible code A fascinating theorem states that there is no proof that a given computer program is maximally compressed but that if it is maximally compressed it is in a rigorous sense not detectably dierent from a random sequence of binary digitsFigure shows a fourdimensional Boolean hypercube with all two to the fourth or sixteen possible binary sequences of length four ranging from to Each sequence is on one of the sixteen vertices of the hypercube and connected to four mutant neighbors achieved by changing a single binary symbol among the four from to or from to Imagine that the minimal program we were considering were a long binary sequence Then that minimal program could be represented as a single vertex on the dimensional Boolean hypercube with to the th to the th dierent sequences hence vertices A remarkable theorem due to Gregory Chaiten shows that if there is a minimal program with binary symbols there is at most about one such minimal bit symbol sequences In short only a single vertex on the dimensional Boolean hypercube corresponds to the desired minimal program Now consider each of the other bit sequences on the hypercube as a computer program Consider a gedankenexperiment a thought experiment for I have not carried out the actual computer experiment and no one has been able to prove my following plausible probably true conjecture Run each binary sequence as the input data and program on our universal computer Measure in some sense how far away the printout of that program is from the correct program for some finite chunk of the correct programs printout If one started with the correct program my bet is that since all redundancy has been removed any single mutation to the code will randomize what the code does Distant bit binary strings will on average be as good or bad an approximation of the correct program as its mutant variantsIf one thinks of the measure of how close the output of a binary string program is to the correct program as the fitness of that trial binary string then the fitness can be thought of as a height The distribution of heights over the dimensional Boolean hypercube therefore creates a fitness landscape In fact my conjecture amounts to stating that the resulting fitness landscape is completely random Neighboring points have fitnesses that have no correlationAssume my conjecture is true There are theorems stating that there is no way to hill climb to the global peak the single correct program by accumulating mutants that gradually improve the program Indeed the only way to find the single good program is eectively to search the entire dimensional Boolean hypercube Youd have to look at most of the vertices on that cube to find the working program The problem is as they say NP hard meaning the size of the problem scales exponentially in the length of the binary symbol sequence But a single example makes a general point Not all complex systems can be assembled by an evolutionary processIt follows that only some complex systems can be assembled by an evolutionary process And it turns out that an evolutionary process based on mutation recombination and selection the genetic search mechanisms of current life does very well on a special kind of fitness landscape where the high peaks tend to cluster near one another and the sides of the peaks are reasonably smooth rather like the high AlpsThen as I first asked in chapter where do such correlated fitness landscapes come from More generally I recall the nofreelunch theorem of Bill Macready and David Wolpert Macready and Wolpert wondered whether averaged over all possible fitness landscapes some search algorithms such as mutation and selection on average outperform all other search algorithms such as random search on the landscape or hill descending or picking birthdays taking their square and jumping that distance in a randomly chosen directionThe nofreelunch theorem proves that averaged over all landscapes no search algorithm outperforms any other Well my goodness On average random search and hill descending do just as well as hill climbing in finding peaks of high fitness And here we organisms are stuck using mutation recombination and selection Yet organisms and ecosystems seem to be pretty complex Once again where did the good landscapes come from the ones that Darwinian gradualism works so well in searchingIn chapter I was led by the above to define natural games as ways of making a living Naturally ways of making a living have evolved as organisms have evolved So rather easily one gets to the conclusion that the winning games are the games that winners playAnd as noted in chapter those ways of making a living that set problems that are well searched out by the search mechanisms of organismsmutation recombination and selectionwill be well searched out Many sibling species will arise and lineages will branch There will be many species making livings and many cases of livings being made that are well searched out by the search mechanisms of organismsIn short there must be a selfconsistent coconstruction of a biosphere in which organisms ways of making a living and search mechanisms jointly and selfconsistently come into existence Organisms are not solving arbitrary problems We are solving the kinds of problems we can solve given our solution procedures How could it be otherwiseSo somehowand we will have to seek plausible mechanismsorganisms are tuning the statistical structure of the fitness landscapes they are searching in evolution But the problem is very much more complex than merely searching a fixed fitness landscape Fitness landscapes are not fixed If the abiotic environment changes the fitness landscape of organisms changes buckles and deformsWorse organisms coevolve My favorite example remains the frog and the fly If the frog develops a sticky tongue the fitness of the fly is altered But so too is the fitness landscape of the fly what it should do next It should develop slippery feet or sticky stu dissolver or a better sense of smell to smell sticky stu before the frog gets too close orSo due to coevolution the fitness landscape of each species heaves and deforms as other species make their adaptive movesA Sojourn to Coevolution in the NK ModelThese results were presented in At Home in the Universe but are needed here Since they are publicly available I will be briefThe NK model is a simple toy world in which an organism has N genes Each gene comes in two alleles or versions or Each allele of each gene makes a contribution to the fitness of the organism that depends on the allele of that gene and upon the alleles of K other genes In genetics these K other genes are called epistatic inputs to the fitness contribution of a given gene The to the N combinations of alleles of the N genes are therefore located on the vertices of the Ndimensional hypercube like Figure The fitness of each type of organism or vertex is written on that vertex and can be thought of as a height Hence the NK model creates a fitness landscape over the Ndimensional Boolean hypercube To keep matters simple I assume all critters have a single chromosome that is are haploids When they are not feeling sexy bacteria will do as an exampleHaving chosen N and K say N and K the rest is done at random in the hopes that generic features of N and K will show up in the resulting statistical structure of the fitness landscape Figure ac In one limiting case the K inputs to each of the N genes are chosen at random from among the N Each gene has two alleles and The fitness contribution of that gene is aected by which of its alleles occurs and by which of the or alleles of K other epistatic input genes occurs Thus each genes fitness contribution is aected by K genesTo study the generic features of such systems I assign once and for all a random fitness contribution to each of the to the K combinations of allele states aecting each of the N genes The fitness contribution is drawn from the uniform interval between and Thus instead of the Boolean functions described above showing when genes turn on and o here I obtain a column vector for each of the to the K allele states aecting a given gene and in each position is a random decimal Once this is done for each of the N genes it remains to define the fitness of an organism with a specific allele at each of the N genes I define this as the average of the fitness contributions of the N genes The results yield a fitness landscape over the Ndimensional hypercube Figure cI will briefly summarize results for the structure of NK landscapes When K each of the N sites is independent There is an optimal allele at each site and hence a globally optimal genotype Any other genotype is suboptimal but can steadily climb to the peak by flipping any gene in a less favorable allele to the opposite more favorable state or So the landscape is like Fujiyama single peaked with smooth sidesWhen K is the maximum value N as in Figure ac then each gene influences the fitness contribution of every gene This is the totally interconnected system Since fitness values are assigned at random for the to the K or to the N input configurations when K N it is easy to show that the resulting fitness landscape is fully randomA main feature of random landscapes is that there are nearly exponentially many local peaks indeed the number of local peaks is to NN For N there are local peaks on the landscape Finding the global peak by hill climbing is improbable and the system becomes trapped on a local peak Other features include the lengths of walks via fitter neighbors to nearby peaks which scales as the logarithm of N and the way directions uphill dwindle on walks uphill At each step uphill the fraction of directions uphill is cut in half yielding exponential slowing in the rate of finding fitter variants hence rather general laws about the rate of improvement slowing exponentially that we will discuss in the next chapter on learning curves in economicsNow on to coevolution and the evolution of the structure of fitness landscapes Figure shows a frog and fly each characterized by an NK landscape coupled together Each of the N genes in the frog receives inputs from K genes in the frog and C genes in the fly and vice versa Thus the sticky tongue of the frog aects the fitness of the fly via the presence or absence in the fly of slippery feet sticky stu dissolver or a strong sense of smell for sticky frog tongues To accommodate the C couplings each gene in the frog looks at K C inputs and has its table of random fitness contributions augmented with new random decimals So too for the fly feeling the eects of the frogNow when the frog population moves by mutation and selection uphill on the frog landscape those moves distort the flys landscape and vice versa Coevolution is a game of coupled deforming landscapes Figure ac show coevolution in model ecosystems with four eight and sixteen species Due to landscape deformations as species coevolve an adaptive move by one species can cause the fitness of other species to decrease In general such coevolving systems can behave in two regimes an ordered regime and a chaotic regime separated by a phase transitionIn Figure a the fourspecies ecosystem eventually settles down to a state where fitnesses stop changing This corresponds to an ordered regime or unchanging evolutionary stable state in which each species has evolved to a local peak on its fitness landscape that is consistent with the peaks occupied by its ecosystem neighbors Once attained each species is better o not changing so long as its neighbors do not change By contrast in the eight and sixteenspecies ecosystems Figures b and c fitnesses continue to jostle up and down as species evolve in a chaotic regime each species chasing the adaptive peaks on its landscape that retreatdue to adaptive moves of other speciesfaster than each species can attain the peaks on its own landscapeA major point of the coevolving NK landscape model is that the creatures can tune the structure of their fitness landscapes each for its own selfish advantage Yet as if by an invisible hand the tuned landscape structure works for the average benefit of all This toy model is to date the only example I know in which creatures tune the structure of their fitness landscapes such that all evolve in problem spaces where in some sense they can search those spaces well selfconsistently with their search mechanismsHere is how the toy model works Each species is represented by a single individual Hence the species is assumed to be isogenic except during the rapid evolution to fitter genotypes that happens as a fitter mutant of a species steps from one point to another point on the landscape Very rapidly it outreproduces its lessfit cousins Hence in this limit the entire species can be said to hop between points on the landscapeAt each move of the computer program any of four events may happen A given species is chosen at random First it may do nothing Second it may change its genotype and if the result is that it is fitter in interacting with its ecosystem neighbors that innovation will be accepted The creature has evolved on its landscape and probably deformed the landscapes of its neighbors Third the critter can change the ruggedness of its landscape by increasing K or decreasing K Landscapes become more rugged and multipeaked as K increases The move altering K is accepted only if that move makes the current genotype of the creature fitter Hence altering the ruggedness of the fitness landscape must pay o for the creature immediately and is accepted selfishly The fourth thing that can happen is rather mean A random other creature say Godzilla is chosen to attempt to invade the current species niche A copy of Godzilla Godzilla connects to the first species ecosystem neighbors and has a go If Godzilla is fitter when coupled to the first species econeighbors than that species that species goes extinct in its niche and is replaced by GodzillaBy the fourth mechanism if Godzilla happens to have a beneficial landscape ruggedness due to its K value that good landscape ruggedness has now replicated from the initial Godzilla to its copy So good landscape ruggedness can spread by natural selection through the model ecosystem hence landscape ruggedness can evolveThe results are shown in Figure Indeed landscape ruggedness does evolve to an intermediate ruggedness During this evolution the mean interval between extinction events increases dramatically hence the mean number of extinction events decreases In this sense all the creatures that remain become fitter due to the coevolutionary tuning of landscape ruggedness In addition when Godzilla replaces the hapless species that now goes extinct its econeighbors find themselves interacting with Godzilla itself They may not be as fit interacting with Godzilla as with the first species hence they too may be invaded and driven extinct in turnIn short avalanches of extinction events can propagate Figure shows that the distribution is a power law with many small and few large extinction events Moreover once a new species comes into existence say Godzilla it may not fare well in its new niche hence may go extinct soon But if it lasts in its niche it may be well adapted hence resistant to being driven extinct The results Figure a are a power law distribution of species lifetimesThus this model shows an invisible hand in which natural selection acting on individuals only tunes landscape ruggedness All players are on average fitter in the sense of surviving as species for much longer periods yet the ecosystem appears selforganized critical with a power law distribution of extinction events Species lifetime distributions are also power lawsDoes this model apply to the real world There is now considerable evidence that over the past million years the size distribution of extinction events in the record in terms of the number of species going extinct per millionyear period is best understood as a power law with many small and few large extinction events Figure Furthermore the lifetime distribution of species as well as genera and families is indeed a power law Figure abI have discussed my own model primarily to focus on the fact that coevolution by selfnatural selection alone acting on individuals alone can tune landscape ruggedness so those landscapes are selfconsistently well searched by the creatures searching them and their search mechanisms We can and presumably do selfconsistently coconstruct ourselves our niches and hence problem spaces and our search mechanisms such that on average we propagate ourselves and our descendants It has worked for billion years Were our fitness landscapes such that we could not search them we would not be here We coconstruct our ways of making a living and search out better ways of making a living while we jiggle one anotherThe NK model is but one crude model of coevolving organisms and their coupled deforming landscapes More generally each organism has traits that are aected by many genes the polygeny discussed above and each gene aects many traits the pleiotropy alluded to above It is interesting to note that were organisms to evolve to a position below but near the biological reality that is the proper analogue of the Ksat phase transition such a location might well achieve the gradualism and capacity to persistently evolve that Darwin noted and that we observe Both the gradualism and capacity to evolve are related to the number of alternative assignments of true or false to the V variables that satisfy the Ksat normal disjunctive form If there are connected pathways from one such assignment via Hammingmutant neighboring assignments that all satisfy the normal disjunctive form then adaptive walks via alternatives genotypes are available all of which roughly generate the same organism Gradualism is achieved Polygeny and pleiotropy tune landscape ruggedness and deformability which tune coevolutionary dynamics perhaps to a selforganized critical state of an ecosystemThere are in short dimly understood laws that allow the coevolutionary construction of accumulating complexity And it appears that such coevolution typically is selforganized critical The NK coevolutionary model is not the only example of a model exhibiting selforganized critical behavior of model ecosystems Bak and colleagues Ricard Sol and others have created elegant models aiming in the same direction In particular Sols model comes closest to fitting the actual slopes of the observed power laws which are Candidate Law Expanding the Adjacent Possible in a SelfOrganized Critical WayHow does the biosphere collectively broach and persistently invade the adjacent possible at the chemical morphological and behavioral levelsI suspect there is a general law and mentioned it in the last section of the previous chapter It is my hopedfor fourth law of thermodynamics for selfconstructing biospheres We enter the adjacent possible hence expand the workspace of our biosphere on average as fast as we canRecall the Noahs Vessel experiment with two of every species ground up in a blender breaking all cell membranes comingling the trillion or so proteins of the hundred million species with the thousands of small molecule metabolites A supracritical explosion of chemical diversity would presumably ensue As I noted life has learned to avoid that fate Cells are subcritical Were they not then any new chemical that chanced to enter the cells of Fredricka the fern would unleash a cascade of synthesis of novel molecular species some of which would presumably kill poor Fredricka Best defense Stay subcritical Why mess with that messBut recall that a mixed microbial community should be able to be driven to the subcriticalsupracritical boundary by increasing the diversity of microbial species present andor hitting the community with a sucient diversity of novel small molecule species My argument follows that if the community is supracritical the novel cascading molecular species will kill o some of the microbial species thereby lowering the community toward the subcritical regime On the other hand mutation and immigration should drive the community toward the supracritical regime Do mixed microbial communities hover on the subcriticalsupracritical boundary We have seen other reasons that bound a communitys complexity including Ksat problems noted in this chapter So a better question is Can microbial communities be driven supracritical And if so are they often near that boundaryOf course I do not know but the hypothesis is testable Increase the diversity of species and test for the diversity of synthesized small molecules say by gas chromatography A colleague and I once devised such an experiment with mixtures of increasingly diverse moss species planning to measure the molecular diversity of gas species evolved as a function of community diversity and the diversity in gas species introduced to the community We went skiing instead I still like the lines of the experiment It could be carried out directly with mixed microbial communities as wellAs noted in the previous chapter there must be some interplay in the entry into the adjacent possible that gates the exploration by the capacity of natural selection to trim away the losers I described the Manfred EigenPeter Schuster error catastrophe If the mutation rate in a population of viruses is low by successive rare successful mutations the population climbs steadily uphill then becomes trapped on or in the near vicinity of a local peakBut let the mutation rate be increased The population on the peak is deformed by the rapid accumulation of mutations and diuses away from the peak into the lowlands of poor fitness Tuning the mutation rate compared to the selection advantage of the fitness peak compared to nearby values on the fitness landscape tunes this error catastrophe Above a critical ratio of the selective advantage at the peak to the mutation rate the population remains near the peak If the mutation rate is slightly higher the population diuses into the highdimensional hinterlands lost adrift in sequence spaceThe error catastrophe is of course rather general Eigen and Schuster consider a fixed highdimensional sequence space like our Ndimensional Boolean hypercube which can be regarded as a sequence space in which molecules have only two nucleotides and C and GBut what about an ever enlarging space of possibilities expanding into an ever larger adjacent possible Here too the rate of exploration of novel possibilities must be gradual enough that natural selection can weed out the losers If not the biosphere as a whole would diuse into new ways of making a living so rapidly that selection would not be able to control the exploration and we would soon falterSo a general balance must be struck We broach the adjacent possible by those exaptations that are not I hold finitely describable beforehand and do so at a rate that manages to work We gate our entry into the adjacent possibleGlobally for the entire biosphere this suggests that we enter the adjacent possible about as fast as we can get away with it On average the global diversity of the biosphere has increased secularly Indeed it would be fascinating to know what has happened to microbial diversity in billion years There are bacteria eating rocks down there two miles below the surface in hot thermal vents in the cold of Antarctic frozen tundra and lake edges all over the placeI do not know the form of the law that governs this exploration Perhaps it is locally selforganized critical in communities multiplied by the number of eectively independent local communities in the biosphere But I can make out a law in which the adjacent possible is invaded such that diversity and coconstructed coevolved complexity accumulate on average as fast as it canI can sense a fourth law of thermodynamics for selfconstructing systems of autonomous agents Biospheres enlarge their workspace the diversity of what can happen next the actual and adjacent possible on average as fast as they can Clues include the fact noted above that for the adjacent possible of a Ndimensional phase space to increase as the biospheres trajectory travels among microstates a secular increase in the symmetry splittings of microstate volumes must occur such that dierent subvolumes go to dierent adjacent possible microstates Eventually such subvolumes hit the Heisenberg uncertainty limit As I noted organisms do touch that limit all over the place in the subtle distinctions that we make turning genes on and o smell sensors on and o and eyes on and o this way and thatThe whole of this chapter suggests that autonomous agents coevolve to be as capable as possible of making the most diverse discriminations and actions take advantage of the most unexpected exaptations coevolve as readily as possible to coconstruct the blossoming diversity that is and remains Darwins tangled bank I sense a fourth law in which the workspace of the biosphere expands on average as fast as it can in this coconstructing biosphereA fourth law for any biosphere I hope so Chapter The Persistently Innovative Econospheret is no accident that the words for economics and ecology have the same Greek root house Ecology and economics are at root the same The economy of Homo habilis and Homo erectus the stunning flaked flint tools of the Magdalinian culture of the magnificent CroMagnon in southern France years ago when the large beasts had retreated southward from the glaciation the invention and spread of writing in Mesopotamia the Greek agora and todays global economy are all in the deepest sense merely the carrying on of the more diversified forms of trade that had their origins with the first autonomous agents and their communities over four billion years agoEconomics has its roots in agency and the emergence of advantages of trade among autonomous agents The advantages of trade predate the human economy by essentially the entire history of life on this planet Advantages of trade are found in the metabolic exchange of legume root nodule and fungi sugar for fixed nitrogen carried in amino acids Advantages of trade were found among the mixed microbial and algal communities along the littoral of the earths oceans four billion years ago The trading of the econosphere is an outgrowth of the trading of the biosphereEconomics has considered itself the science of allocation of scarce resources In doing so it shortchanges its proper domain Indeed if we stand back and squint it is easy to see the most awesome feature of an economy and its roots in autonomous agents The most awesome feature of the econosphere as of the biosphereboth built by communities of autonomous agents in their urgent plunging lunging sliding gliding hiding trading and providinghas been a blossoming diversity of molecular and organismic species and of novel ways of making a living that has persistently burgeoned into the adjacent possible From tens of organic molecular species to tens of trillions from one or a few species of autonomous agents to a standing diversity of some hundred million species and a total diversity some hundred to thousandfold larger of those creatures come and goneHomo erectus had fire and early tools Homo habilis traded stone axe parts million years ago The diversity of CroMagnon goods and services in the south of France some years ago may have numbered in the several hundreds to a few thousands Today surf the web and count the diversity of goods and services the ways of making a living it is in the millionsNeither the biosphere nor the econosphere are merely about the distribution of limited resources both are expressions of the immense creativity of the universe and in particular of autonomous agents as we exapt molecularly morphologically and technologically in untold unforetellable ways persistently into the adjacent possible Jobs and job holders jointly coevolve into existence in the econosphere in an everexpanding web of diverse complexityOne of the most striking facts about current economic theory is that it has no account of this persistent secular explosion of diversity of goods services and ways of making a living Strange is it not that we have no theory of these overwhelming facts of the biosphere and econosphere Strange is it not that we pay no attention to one of the most profound features of the world right smack in front of our collective nose And consistent with this strangeness the most comprehensive theory the rock foundation of modern economics the beautiful competitive general equilibrium theory of Arrow and Debreu does not and cannot discuss this explosion perhaps the most important feature of the economyGeneral Competitive Equilibrium and Its LimitationsSo we begin with an outline of competitive general equilibrium as the cornerstone conceptual framework of modern economics Ken Arrow is a friend As one of the inventors of the framework Ken is more at liberty to be a critic than the two generations of economists who have followed in his footsteps My best reading of Kens view which I share is that competitive general equilibrium is at present the only overarching framework we have to think about the economy as a whole Yet Ken suspects that that framework is incomplete I agreeCompetitive general equilibrium grows out of a conceptual framework in which the core question is how prices form such that markets clear Recall the famous supplyanddemand curves for a single good Figure As a function of increasing price plotted on the xaxis supply plotted on the yaxis increases from low to high More companies are willing to create widgets as the price per widget increases On the other hand demand where demand is also plotted on the yaxis decreases from high to low as prices increase Fewer customers are willing to buy widgets as the price per widget increasesAs the figure shows the supplyanddemand curves cross at some price At that price the markets clear that is all the widgets supplied are purchased The price at which markets clear is the equilibrium priceFor a single good the problem is simple But consider bread and butter Since many of us like butter on our bread the demand for butter depends not only on the price and hence the supply of butter but also on the price of bread hence on the supply of bread And vice versa the demand for bread depends upon the price of butter and hence on the supply of butter For thousands of goods where the demand for any one good depends upon the price of many goods and the supply of any one good depends upon the price of many goods it is not so obvious that there is a price for each good such that all markets clearBut worse the supply or demand for bread today may be dierent than the supply or demand for bread tomorrow And still worse the supply or demand for bread tomorrow may depend on all sorts of odd contingent facts For example if severe cold kills the winter wheat next month the supply of bread will drop if a bumper crop of winter wheat comes available globally because of weather or suddenly improved irrigation and farming practices worldwide the supply will go upArrow and Debreu made brilliant steps First they consider a space of all possible dated and contingent goods One of their examples of a dated contingent good is ton of wheat delivered in Chicago on May under the condition that the average rainfall in Nebraska for the six preceding months has been percent less than normal for the past fifty years and that the Boston Red Sox won the World Series the previous yearIn the ArrowDebreu theory we are to imagine an auctioneer who at a defined beginning of time say this morning holds an auction covering all possible dated contingent goods All suppliers and customers gather at this imaginary auction bidding ensues for all possible dated contingent goods with values calculated under dierent hypotheses about the probabilities that the dierent dated contingencies will come about At the end of an imaginary hour of frantic bargaining the auction closes All participants now have contracts to buy or sell all possible dated contingent goods each at a fixed price Everybody hustles home to watch Good Morning America And wondrously however the future unfolds whether theres rain sun or snow in Nebraska the dated contingent contracts that are appropriate come due the contracts are fulfilled at the preestablished price for each contract and all markets clearIt is mindboggling that Arrow and Debreu proved these results The core means of the solution depends upon what mathematicians call fixedpoint theorems A beginning case is your hair particularly for males where short hair makes the fixed point easy to see When you comb your hair in a normal fashion there is a point roughly on top of your head slightly to the back where a roughly circular swirl of hair occurs ignoring baldness around a fixed point where typically a bit of scalp shows throughA general theorem considers hair on a spherical surface and combing the hair in any way you want You cannot avoid a fixed point More generally replace hair by arrows with tails and heads where each arrow is a line with an arrow head at one end drawn on the surface of the sphere The arrows may bend if you like Each arrow can be thought of as mapping the point on the sphere at the tail of that arrow to the point of the sphere at the tip of that arrow So the arrows are a mapping of the surface of the sphere onto itself For a continuous mapping such that there is a mapping from each point on the sphere a general fixedpoint theorem proves that there must be at least one point on the surface of the sphere that maps onto itselfthat point is a fixed point under the arrow mappingThe wonderful ArrowDebreu general competitive equilibrium theorems depend on such a fixed point In a space where all possible dated contingent goods can be prestated and all possible markets for trade of all such goods exist a fixed point also exists that corresponds to a price at which all such markets clear however the future unfolds Arrow and Debreu won the Nobel Prize for their work and won it deservedly It is a beautiful theory Yet there are important critiques of general competitive equilibrium For example the theorem depends on complete markets that is markets to trade all possible dated contingent goods and fine economists have raised issues about how well the theory works if markets are incomplete as indeed they areI pose however a wider set of issues The overarching feature of the economy over the past million years or so is the secular increase in the diversity of goods and services from a dozen to a dozen million or more today Nowhere does general competitive equilibrium speak about this Nor can the theory speak about the growth in diversity of goods and services for it assumes at the outset that one can finitely prestate all possible dated contingent goods Then the theory uses complete markets and a fixedpoint theorem to prove that a price exists such that markets clearBut we have seen grounds to be deeply suspicious of the claim that we can finitely prestate all possible exaptationswhether they be new organic functionalities or new goodsthat arise in a biosphere or an econosphere such as Gertrude learning to fly in her terrified leap from the pine tree million years ago last Friday or the engineers working on the tractor suddenly realizing that the engine block itself could serve as the chassisI do not believe for a moment that we can finitely prestate all possible goods and services Indeed economists intuitively know this They distinguish between normal uncertainty and Knightian uncertainty Normal uncertainty is the kind we are familiar with in probability theory concerning flipping coins I am unsure whether in flips there will be heads and tails Thanks to lots of work I can now calculate the probability of any outcome in the finitely prestated space of possible outcomesKnightian uncertainty concerns those cases where we do not yet know the possible outcomes Knightian uncertainty has rested in an epistemologically uncomfortable place in economics and elsewhere Why Because we have not realized that we cannot finitely prestate the configuration space of a biosphere or an econosphere by contrast Newton Laplace Boltzmann Einstein and perhaps Bohr have all more or less presupposed that we can finitely prestate the configuration space of any domain open to scientific enquiry After all as I have noted we can and do prestate the N configuration space for a liter of N gas particlesFrom this point of view the wonderful ArrowDebreu theory is fundamentally flawedMoreover general competitive equilibrium seen as a culmination of one central strand of economic theory is too limited Insofar as economics is concerned with understanding the establishment of prices at which markets clear general competitive equilibrium was a masterpiece But insofar as economics is or should be concerned with how and why economies increase the diversity of goods and services the reigning theory is a nonstarter And since the growth in wealth per capita over the past million years is deeply related to the growth in the diversity of technology and goods and services contemporary economics is clearly inadequateWe need a theory of the persistent coming into existence of new goods and services and extinction of old goods and services rather like the persistent emergence of new species in an ecosystem and extinction of old species In the previous chapter we discussed ecosystems as selforganized critical We discussed the biosphere and econosphere as advancing into the adjacent possible in selforganized critical small and large bursts of avalanches of speciation and extinction events We discussed the power law distribution of extinction events in the biological record And we discussed the power law distribution of lifetimes of species and generaBut the econosphere has similar extinction and speciation events Consider my favorite example The introduction of the automobile drove the horse as a mode of transport extinct With the horse went the barn the buggy the stable the smithy the saddlery the Pony Express With the car came paved roads an oil and gas industry motels fastfood restaurants and suburbia The Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter called these gales of creative destruction where old goods die and new ones are born One bets that Schumpeterian gales of creative destruction come in a power law distribution with many small avalanches and few large ones More if species and genera have a power law distribution of lifetimes what of firms Firms do show a similar power law distribution of lifetimes Most firms die young some last a long time We may bet that technologies show similar avalanches of speciation and extinction events and lifetime distributionsThe parallels are at least tantalizing and probably more than that While the mechanisms of heritable variation dier and the selection criteria dier organisms in the biosphere and firms and individuals in the econosphere are busy trying to make a living and explore new ways of making a living In both cases the puzzling conditions for the evolutionary cocreation and coassembly of increasing diversity are present The biosphere and econosphere are persistently transforming persistently inventing persistently dying persistently getting on with it and on average persistently diversifying And into a framework of such a diversifying set of goods and services we must graft the central insights of general competitive equilibrium as the approximate shorttimescale mechanism that achieves a roughandready approximate clearing of markets at each stage of the evolution of the economyA rough hypothetical biological example may help understand market clearing in a more relaxed formal framework than general competitive equilibrium Consider two bacterial species red and blue Suppose the red species secretes a red metabolite at metabolic cost to itself that aids the replication rate of the blue species Conversely suppose the blue species secretes a dierent blue metabolite at metabolic cost to itself that increases the replication rate of the red species Then the conditions for a mutualism are possible Roughly stated if blue helps red more than it costs itself and vice versa a mixed community of blue and red bacteria may grow How will it happen And is there an optimal exchange rate of bluesecreted metabolite to redsecreted metabolite where that exchange rate is the analogue of priceWell it can and does happen Here is the gedankenexperiment Imagine an ordered set of blue mutant bacteria that secrete dierent amounts of the blue metabolite that helps the red bacteria Say the range of secretion is from to molecules per minute per blue bacterium with metabolic cost to the blue bacteria proportional to the number of molecules secreted Conversely imagine mutant red bacteria that secrete from to of the red molecules valuable to the blue bacteria at a similar cost proportional to the number of molecules secretedNow create a large square petri plate with rows and columns drawn on the plastic below to guide your experimental hands Arrange the rows numbered to to correspond to blue bacteria secreting to molecules a second Arrange the columns numbered to to correspond to the red bacteria secreting to molecules a second Into each of the x cells on your square petri plate place exactly one red and one blue bacterium with the corresponding secretion rates Thus in the upper left bacteria that are low blue and low red secretors are coplated onto each square On the lower left high blue and low red secretors are coplated On the upper right low blue and high red secretors are coplated And in the lower right corner high red and high blue bacteria are coplatedGo for lunch and dinner and come back the next day In general among the coplated pairs of bacteria while all colonies will have grown a single pair will have grown to the largest mixed redblue bacterial colony Say the largest mixed redblue colony corresponds to red secreting molecules per second blue secreting molecules per secondThis gedankenexperiment is important for the exchange ratio of red and blue molecules is the analogue of price the ratio of trading of oranges for apples And there exists a ratio red molecules to blue molecules per second that maximizes the growth of the mixed redblue bacterial colony Since the fastest growing mixed redblue colony will exponentially outgrow all others and dominate our gedankenexperiment petri plate this redblue pair establishes price in the system at red to blue molecules Further in the fastest growing redblue colony where red secretes molecules and blue secretes molecules per second both the red and blue bacteria in that mixed colony are replicating at the identical optimum rate As discussed in chapter using a rough mapping of biology to economics that rate of replication of a bacterium corresponds to economic utility and the increased the rate of replication corresponds to increased economic utility The red and blue bacteria not only establish price but they also share equally the advantages of trade present along the Paretoecient contract curve in the Edgeworth box discussed in chapter Mutualists in the biosphere have been hacking out rough price equilibria for millions of years and have done so without foresight and without the ArrowDebreu fixedpoint theorems Indeed critters have been hacking out rough price equilibria even as exaptations and new ways of living have come into existence and old ways have perished Presumably these rough biological price equilibria are reached because in the short and intermediate term they optimize the fitness of both of the mutualists And the markets clear in the sense that all the red molecules are exchanged for blue molecules per second But its a selforganized critical world out there with small and large avalanches of speciation and extinction events in the biosphere and econosphere and equilibrium price or no most species and technologies job holders and jobs are no longer among us to mumble about advantages of tradeI confess I am happier with this image of prices established in local roughandready ways at many points in an ecosystem or economy than with the beautiful fixedpoint theorems of general competitive equilibrium Bacteria and horseshoe crabs keep establishing rough price equilibria in their mutualisms without a prespecified space of ways of making a living If they can do it so can we mere humans Getting on with it in the absence of predefined configuration spaces has been the persistent provenance of autonomous agents since we stumbled into existenceRational Expectations and Its LimitationsActually there has been a major extension of general competitive equilibrium called rational expectations Like general competitive equilibrium this theory too is beautiful but I think deeply flawedRational expectations grew in part out of an attempt to understand actual trading on stock exchanges Under general competitive equilibrium little trading should occur and stock prices should hover in the vicinity of their fundamental value typically understood as the discounted present value of the future revenue stream from the stock But in fact abundant trading does occur and speculative bubbles and crashes occur Rational expectations theory is built up around another fixedpoint theorem Rational expectations theory assumes a set of economic agents with beliefs about how the economy is working The agents base their economic actions on those beliefs A fixed point can exist under which the actions of the agents given their beliefs about the economy exactly create the expected economic behavior So under rational expectations one can understand bubbles It is rational to believe that prices are going above fundamental value and thus to invest and the investments sustain the bubble for a period of timeMeanwhile Homo economicus has been thought to be infinitely rational In the ArrowDebreu setting such infinitely rational agents bargain and achieve the best equilibrium price for each dated contingent good In rational expectations the agents figure out how the economy is working and behave in such a way that the expected economic system is the one that arises The theories and actions of the agents selfconsistently create an economy fitting the theories under which the agents operateBut beautiful as these fixedpoint theorems are there are two troubles in the rational expectations framework First the beautiful fixed points may not be stable to minor fluctuations in agent behaviors Under fluctuations the economic system may progressively veer away from the fixed point into a feared conceptual nomansland Second achieving the fixed points seems to demand excessive rationality to fit real human agents So it appears necessary to extend rational expectationsOne direction was broached thirty years ago when economist Herb Simon introduced the terms satisficing and bounded rationality Both seem sensible but have been problematic Satisficing suggests that agents do not optimize but do well enough yet it has been hard to make this concept pay o It has also been hard to make advances with the concept of bounded rationality for the simple reason that there is one way typically of being infinitely smart and indefinitely many ways of being rather stupid What determines the patterns of bounded stupidity How should economic theory proceedNatural Rationality Is BoundedI suspect that there may be a natural extension to rational expectations applicable to human and any strategic agents and I report a body of work suggested by me but largely carried out by Vince Darley at Harvard for his doctoral thesis Two virtues of our eorts are to find a natural bound to infinite rationality and a natural sense of satisficingThe core ideas stated for human agents are these Suppose you have a sequence of events say the price of corn by month and want to predict next months price of corn Suppose you have data for twenty months Now Fourier invented his famous decomposition which states that any wiggly line on a blackboard can be approximated with arbitrary accuracy by a weighted sum of sine and cosine waves of dierent wavelengths and phase osets chosen out of the infinite number of possible sine and cosine functions with all possible wavelengthsNow you could try to fit the data on the corn prices with the first Fourier mode namely the average price But presumably if the twenty prices vary a fair amount that average will not predict the twentyfirst months price very well You have underfit the data Or you could use twenty or more Fourier modes all dierent wavelengths with dierent phase osets and you would roughly wind up drawing a straight line between the adjacent pairs of points in the twentyperiod series This procedure will not help too much in predicting the twentyfirst period You have overfit the data by using too many Fourier modesTypically optimal prediction of the twentyfirst period price will be achieved by using two to five Fourier modes each of dierent wavelength and dierent phase oset As is well known in the art you have neither underfit nor overfit your dataThis fact suggests that the optimal prediction of a short sequence of data is obtained by a model of intermediate complexitya few Fourier modes neither a single one nor very many The sense of bounded rationality Vince and I want to advocate is that optimal prediction of a limited time series is achieved with models using only a few Fourier modes or their analogs in other basis setsmodels of modest or bounded complexityThe rest of the theory Vince and I have developed goes to show that agents who have theories of one another and act selfishly based on those theories will typically create a persistently changing pattern of actions Therefore they persistently create a nonstationary world in which only the relatively recent past has valid data Thus there is always only a limited amount of valid data on which to base theories and the agents in turn must always build models of intermediate bounded complexity to avoid over or underfitting the meager valid dataNatural rationality is in this sense bounded It is bounded because we mutually create nonstationary worlds What happens is that the agents act under their theories But in due course some agent acts in a way that falsifies the theories of one or more other agents These agents either are stubborn or change their theories If they change their theories of the first agent then typically they also change their actions In turn those changes disconfirm the theory of the first agent and perhaps still other agents So the agents wind up in a space of coevolving theories and actions with no fixedpoint stable steady states which means that past actions are a poor guide to future actions by an agent since his theories and hence his action plans have changed But this means that the agents mutually create a nonstationary time series of actions nonstationary just means that the statistical characteristics of the time series keep changing because the agents keep changing their theories and actions In turn the agents typically have only a modest amount of relatively recent data that is still valid and reliable on which to base their next theories of one another Given only a modest amount of valid and reliable data the agents must avoid overfitting or underfitting that smallish amount of data so they must use theories of intermediate complexityfor example four Fourier modes to fit the data not one or twentyVince and I want to say that natural rationality is bounded to models of intermediate complexity because we collectively and persistently create nonstationary worlds together In the agentbased computer models Vince has created for his thesis just this behavior is seen Indeed we allow agents to evolve how much of the past history of the interactions they will pay attention to and how complex their models of one another will beone four or fifty Fourier modes Agents evolve in a history and complexity space to find currently optimal amounts of history and complexity to use to optimally predict their neighbors In our little world the agents evolve to use a modest history ignoring the distant past and only modestly complex theories of one anotherWe have found evidence of a further perhaps generic property that appears to drive such systems to settle down then change in a sudden burst As the system of agents and actions settles down to some repeatable behavior an increasingly wide range of alternative theories simple and very complex fit the same data But the complex theories with many Fourier modes attempt to predict fine details of the repeatable behavior As those theories become more complex they are more fragile because they can be disconfirmed by ever more minor fluctuations in the repeatable behavior Sooner or later such a fluctuation happens and the agents with the complex disconfirmed theories change theories and actions radically setting up a vast avalanche of changes of theories and actions that sweeps the system driving the collective behavior far from any repeatable pattern In these new circumstances only a small subset of theories fits the current facts so the diversity and complexity of theories in the population of agents plummets and the system finds its way back to some repeatable pattern of behaviorIn short there appears to be not only a bounded complexity in our rationality but a fragilitystability cyclic oscillation in our joint theories and actions as well In these terms the system of agents and theories never settles down to a fixedpoint equilibrium in which markets clear Instead the system repeatedly fluctuates away from the contract curve then returns to new points in the vicinity of the contract curve Hence in precisely the sense of repeatedly fluctuating away from a contract curve then returning to its vicinity the system does not achieve an optimizing price equilibrium but satisficesThe bounded complexity issues would seem to apply to any coevolving autonomous agents that are able to make theories of one another and base actions on those theories The tiger chasing the gazelle and the starfish predating the trilobite are we suppose Popperian creatures able to formulate hypotheses about their worlds that may sometimes die in their stead Presumably all such autonomous agents under persistent mutation and selection would opt for changeable models of one another of bounded complexityWhile these steps are only a beginning to go beyond rational expectations in economics they seem promising Whatever natural or unnatural games autonomous agents are playing as they and we coevolve in a biosphere or econosphere nonstationarity arises on many levels Here we see it at the level of the agents theories of one another and the actions based on those theories Perhaps this is just part of how the world works Given the semantic import of yuck and yum and the reality of natural games for fox and hare for E coli and paramecium these changing theories and actions are part of the fabric of history of the market the savannah and the small pondNatural rationality is bounded by the very nonstationarity of the worlds we cocreate as we coexaptTechnology Graphs and Economic WebsLife takes its unexpected turns I have been an academic scientist a biologist for thirty years at the University of Chicago the National Institutes of Health the University of Pennsylvania then twelve stunningly exciting years at the Santa Fe Institute After thirty years Ive written the canonical hundred or more scientific articles was fortunate enough to receive a MacArthur Fellowship during whose five years my IQ went up and then slumped back to normal as the funding ended invented and patented this and that and published two previous books of which I am proud Origins of Order and At Home in the Universe both by Oxford University PressI thought Origins and At Home were largely about the challenge of extending Darwinism to an account of evolution that embraced both selforganization and natural selection in some new still poorly understood marriage One hundred and forty years after Darwin after all we still have only inklings about the kinds of systems that are capable of adaptation What principles if any govern the coevolutionary assembly of complex systems such as ecosystems or British common law where a new finding by a judge alters precedent in ways that ricochet in small and large avalanches through the law If new determinations by judges did not have any wider impact the law could not evolve If every new determination altered interpretation of precedents throughout the entire corpus of common law the law also could not evolveMy rough bet is that systems capable of coevolutionary construction such as British common law can evolve and accumulate complexity because they are somehow selforganized critical and a power law distribution of avalanches of implications of new precedent ricochet in the law and in other complex coevolving systems to allow complexity to accumulate Indeed based on selforganized criticality and more particularly on the analysis of the NK fitness landscape model discussed in Origins and At Home and the patches version of the NK model discussed in At Home I am rather persuaded that adapting systems can best exploit the tradeo between exploitation and exploration at a rough phase transition between order and chaos Here power law distributions of small and large avalanches of change can and do propagate through the system as it adaptsSo saying and having published Origins and then At Home I was rather surprised to find business people approaching me The consulting companies of McKinsey Coopers and Lybrand Anderson and Ernst and Young began visiting the Santa Fe Institute to learn about the new sciences of complexity In due course Chris Meyer at the Center for Business Innovation at Ernst and Young asked me if I might be interested in forming a fiftyfifty partnership with E and Y to discover if complexity science that nuanced term could be applied in the practical world I found myself deeply intrigued Was the work of my colleagues and myself mere theory or did it have application in real biospheres and econospheres Why not plunge in and try my best to find out to do it right even knowing how early was the stage of the science we had been inventingBios Group Inc the partnership with Ernst and Young is now just threeandahalf years old We have grown to over seventy people heading we hope for a hundred Our annual revenues are running at million We have a hopeful eye on to million this year with clients ranging from Texas Instruments for whom we invented a novel adaptive chip to the US Marine Corps with its concern for adaptive combat to Unilever the NASDAQ stock market Honda Boeing Johnson and Johnson Procter Gamble Kellogg Southwest Airlines the Joint Chiefs of Sta and others We have spun out a biotechnology company CIStem Molecular that aims to clone the small cis acting DNA regions that control turning genes on and o in development and disease a European daughter company EuroBios as well as EXA a company spun out with NASDAQ to make tools for financial markets Im deeply glad to be chairman of the board and chief scientist of Bios to be working with a very creative group of colleagues and to be finding routes in the practical world where our ideas do in fact applyI mention Bios and my involvement because some of the science we have done bears on diverse aspects of practical economics and even begins to suggest pathways beyond the limitations of the ArrowDebreu theory I begin with Boeing which came to Bios wondering how to design and build airplanes in a year rather than seven years Out of what modular parts and processes wonder Boeing folks might it be possible to assemble a family of related aircraft for a diversity of marketsThe obvious approach was to invent Lego World As founding general partner and chief scientist I duly authorized the expenditure of to buy a largish box of Lego parts In truth I fib I actually won the Lego box at our first Bios Christmas partyMost of the readers of this book will be familiar with Lego It is a construction game consisting of snaptogether plastic parts based on square blocks that graduate in size for example x x x and x blocks The blocks can be assembled into wonderfully complex structures as many delighted children and adults have discoveredBut what might Lego World be What indeed Well consider a large pile of Lego blocks on a bare wooden table Consider these blocks the primitive parts Now consider all the primitive construction or deconstruction operations pressing two parts together or adding a primitive part to a growing assemblage or taking a part o another part or o an assemblageConsider the pile of unassembled bare Lego parts as the founder set and place in rank all the unique Lego objects that can be constructed from the founder set in a single construction step Thus a x can be attached in a specific overlapping way to a x Now place in rank all the unique Lego objects that can be constructed from the founder set in two construction or deconstruction steps Similarly consider ranks A set of primitive parts and the transformations of those parts into other objects is a technology graph In fact a technology graph is deeply similar to a chemicalreaction bipartite graph from a founder set of organic molecules where the molecules are the objects and the reaction hyperedges linking substrate and products are the transformations among the objects The graph is bipartite because there are two types of entities nodes and hyperedges representing objects and transformationsThe first thing to notice about the Lego World technology graph is that it might extend o to infinity given an infinite number of primitive Lego partsThe second thing to notice is that within Lego World an adjacent possible relative to any actual set of primitive and more complex Lego structures is perfectly definable The adjacent possible is just that set of unique novel objects not yet constructed that can be constructed from the current set of Lego objects in a single construction step Of course within the limited world of Lego we can think of the technologically adjacent possible from any actual A Lego economy might flow persistently from simple primitive objects into the adjacent possible building up evermore complex objectsA third feature is that we might consider specific Lego machines made of Lego parts each able to carry out one or more of the primitive gluing or ungluing operations Lego World could build up the machine tools to build other objects including other toolsIndeed in Origins of Order and At Home in the Universe I borrowed theoretical chemist Walter Fontanas algorithmic chemistry and defined a mathematical analogue of Lego World namely a grammar model of an economy In that model binary symbol strings represented goods and services as do Lego objects in Lego World In a grammar model grammar specifies how symbol strings act on symbol strings rather like machines on inputs to produce new symbol strings In Lego World the grammar is specified by the ways primitive blocks can be attached or unattached and by any designation of which Lego objects can carry out which primitive construction operations The grammar in question may be simple and contextinsensitive or a far richer contextsensitive grammar in which what objects can be added in what ways to dierent objects depends upon the small or large context surrounding those blocks In short in a contextsensitive grammar the objects and transformations rules are sensitive to the context of the objects and previous transformations themselvesBefore proceeding with current uses of Lego World and its intellectual children notice that Lego World like the grammar models in Origins and At Home can become the locus of an economy in which the sets of goods and services can expand over time and in which speciation and extinction events occur In Origins and At Home I built upon a suggestion of economist Paul Romer and specified that each symbol stringor here each Lego objecthas some utility to a single consumer The utility of each object to the consumer is subjected to exponential discounting over time A Lego house today is worth more than a Lego house tomorrow and still more than a Lego house two days from now And for simplicitys sake the total utility of a bundle of goods is the sum of their discounted utilities to the consumerNext I invoked a social planner The task of the social planner is to plan a pattern of production activities over time that optimizes the discounted happiness of the consumer A standard approach is to adopt a finite planning horizon The social planner thinks ahead say ten periods finds that pattern of construction activities over time that creates the sequence of symbolstring goods or Lego objects that maximizes the timediscounted happiness of the consumer Then the social planner initiates the firstperiod plan making the first set of objects Next the planner considers a tenperiod planning horizon from period to period deduces the optimal secondperiod plan taking account of the newly considered eleventh period and carries out the secondperiod planBecause the total utility to the consumer is a simple sum of the discounted utilities of all the possible goods in the economy finding the optimal plan at any period is just a linear programming problem and the results are a fixed ratio of construction activities of all the objects produced at that period The fixed ratio of the activities is the mirror of price relative to one good taken as the arbitrary currency or numeraireOver time the model economy ticks forward At each period in general only some of the possible goods and services are constructed The others do not make the consumer happy enough Over time new goods and services come into existence and old ones go out of existence in small and large avalanches of speciation and extinction eventsThus a grammar model or a physical instantiation of a grammar model such as Lego World is a toy world with a technology graph of objects and transformations With the addition of utilities to the dierent objects for one consumer or a set of consumers and a social planneror more generally with a set of utilities for the objects that may dier among consumers and with dierent costs and scaling of costs with sizes of production runs of dierent Lego objectsa market economy can be constructed With defined startup costs costs of borrowing money and bankruptcy rules a model economy with an evolving set of goods and services can be created and studiedIn general such economies will advance persistently into the adjacent possible And because the number of unique Lego objects in each rank is larger than the number in the preceding rank the diversity of opportunities and objects tends to increase as ever more complex objects are constructedMore generally we need to consider complements and substitutes Screw and screwdriver are complements screw and nail are substitutes Complements must be used together to create value substitutes replace one another Rather obviously the complements and substitutes of any good or service constitute the economic niche in which that good or service lives New goods enter the economy typically as complements and substitutes for existing goods There is just no point in inventing the channel changer before the television set is invented and television programming is developedAn economic web is just the set of goods and services in an economy linked by red lines between substitutes and green lines between complementsAs we have seen over the past million years and even the past hundred years the diversity of the economic web has increased Why Because as in Lego World the more objects there are in the economy the more complement and substitute relations exist among those objects as well as potential new objects in the adjacent possible If there are N objects the number of potential complement or substitute relations scales at least as N squared since each object might be a complement or substitute of any object Thus as the diversity of the objects in the web increases the diversity of prospective niches for new goods and services increases even more rapidly The very diversity of the economic web is autocatalyticIf this view is correct then diversity of goods and services is a major driver of economic growth Indeed I believe that the role of diversity of goods and services is the major unrecognized factor driving economic growth Jane Jacobs had made the same point in her thoughtful books about the relation between economic growth and economic diversity of cities and their hinterlands Economist Jose Scheinkman now chairman of economics at the University of Chicago and his colleagues studied a number of cities normalized for total capitalization and found that economic growth correlated with economic diversity in the city In a similar spirit microfinancing of a linked diversity of cottage businesses in the third world and the first world seems to be achieving local economic growth where more massive eorts at education and infrastructure Aswan dams and power grids seem to failIndeed in the same way in an ecosystem organisms create niches for other organisms I suspect therefore that over the past billion years the growth of diversity of species is autocatalytic for the number of possible niches increases more rapidly than the number of species filling niches And in the linking of spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes the universe as a whole advances autocatalytically into its adjacent possible driven by the very increase of diversity by which novel displacements from equilibrium come into existence are detected are coupled to and come to drive the endergonic creation of novel kinds of molecules and other entities Economic growth is part and parcel of the creativity of the universe as a wholeThink of the Wright brothers airplane It was a recombination between an airfoil a light gasoline engine bicycle wheels and a propeller The more objects an economy has the more novel objects can be constructed When we were working with rough stone in the Lower Paleolithic we pretty much mastered everything that could be done until pressure flaking came along Most forms of simple stone tools that could be made were made Today the adjacent possible of goods and services is so vast that the economy stumbling and lunging into the future adjacent possible will only construct an ever smaller subset of the technologically possibleThe economy is ever more historically contingent As the biosphere is ever more historically contingent As I suspect the universe is ever more historically contingentWe are on a trajectory given a classical Ndimensional phase space where the dimensionality of the adjacent possible does seem to increase secularly and the universe is not about to repeat itself in its nonergodic flowA fourth lawI now discuss an algorithmic model of the real economic web the one outside in the bustling world of the shopping mall of mergers and acquisitions While powerful however no algorithmic model is complete for neither the biosphere nor the econosphere is finitely prestatable Indeed the eort to design and construct an algorithmic model of the real economic web will simultaneously help us see the weakness of any finite descriptionIt all hangs on objectoriented programming A case in point is the recent advent of Java an objectbased language which as of February had a library of some eighty thousand Java objects Goodness knows how fast this library of objects is growing Among the Java objects are carburetor objects engine block objects and piston objects and objects come with functional descriptors such as is a has a does a needs a uses aBoth implicitly and with modest work explicitly the piston object can discover that it fits into the cylinder hole in the engine block object to create a completed piston in a cylinder The carburetor object can discover that it is to be located on top of the engine block object connected to certain gas line objects in certain waysThe physical engine block and piston in reality are complements used together to create value Thus the representations of the engine block and piston as algorithmic Java objects together with algorithmic search engines to match the corresponding is a has a does a functions of complements and even substitutes can as a matter of principleand practicalitycreate an image of the real complements and substitutes in the real economic webIn a fundamental sense an appropriate set of Java objects together with search engines for complements and substitutes matching is a has a does a constitutes a grammar of objects and linkings or transformations among objects The grammar may be context independent or context sensitive or richerIn short properly carried out Java objects and the proper search engines can create a technology graph of all the objects and transformed objects constructible from any founder set of objects The Java objects are like Lego World And Lego World stated in terms of building simple combinatorial objects is logically similar to a set of objectives that must be achieved by a military force to carry out its total objective Entities and operations are deeply similar as we will explore further below Technology graphs concern objects and actions things and objectives products and processes in a single frameworkTherefore in principle we have begun to specify a means to characterize large patches of the global economic web Let each of very many firms at dierent levels of disaggregation create Java objects proper to their activities building materials partially processed materials partially achieved objectives and objectives including products Let these Java objects be characterized by appropriate is a has a does a lists with adequate search engines looking for complements and substitutes The result is a distributed web of Java objects linked functionally in at least many or most of the ways that are actually in use as complements and substitutes creating the millions of dierent goods and services in the current economyMuch is of interest about such data on the real economic web Among other features any such graph has graphtypical characteristics Some goods are central to the web the car computer and so forth Others are peripheral such as the hula hoop and pet rock Presumably location of its products in the web structure has a great deal to do with the strategic position of a firmBut there is more for the economic web states its own adjacent possible Given the Queen Mary and an umbrella the umbrella placed in the smoke stack of the Queen Mary is in the adjacent possible Not much use But what about a small umbrella on the back of a Cessna that opens upon landing Ah an air brake is a possible new good in the adjacent possible a few steps from hereAnd still more What are the statistics of the transformation of an economic web over time as new goods and services arise in the niches aorded by existing goods and services and drive old goods and services extinct No one makes Roman siege engines these days Cruise missiles do the job betterI believe such objectbased economic web tools will come into existence in the near future Indeed Bios Group is involved in inventing and making them And I believe that such tools will be very powerful means of coordinating activities within supply chains and within the larger economy when linked by automated marketsBut I do not believe any such algorithmic tool can be complete Consider the case of the engineers discovering that the engine block is so rigid that the block itself can serve as the chassis for the tractor they are trying to invent That exaptation seems a genuine discovery Now imagine that we had had Java object models of all the parts that were to go into the tractor engine block objects carburetor objects piston objects If among the properties of the engine blockthe proud is a has a does a featureswe had not listed ahead of time the very rigidity of the engine block or if that rigidity was not deducible from the other listed properties then my vaunted economic web model with its algorithmically accessible adjacent possible could not have ever come up with the suggestion Use the engine block due to its rigidity as the chassisYou see again that unless there is a finite predescription of all the potentially relevant properties of a real physical object our algorithmic approach can be powerful but incomplete Yet I cannot see how to construct such a finite predescription of all the potentially relevant properties of a real physical object in the real universeThe world is richer than all our dreams HoratioI must say to Arrow and Debreu Gentlemen the set of goods and services is not finitely prestatable so fixedpoint theorems are of limited useAnd to my economist colleagues Consider the economy as forever becoming burgeoning with new ways of making a living new ways of creating value and advantages of trade while old ways go extinct This too is the proper subject for your study not just allocation of scarce resources and achievement of marketclearing prices The economy like the biosphere is about persistent creativity in ways of making a livingI find it intriguing to note certain parallels from our prior discussion of autonomous agents and propagating organization At the level of molecular autonomous agents I made the point repeatedly that work is the constrained release of energy and that autonomous agents do carry out work to construct the constraints on the release of energy such that the energy is released along specific channels and such that specific couplings of nonequilibrium energy sources to propagating organization arise Think then of the role of laws and contracts whose constraints enable the linked flow of economic activities down particular corridors of activities The web of economic activities flows down channels whose constraints are largely legal in nature The coming into existence of the enabling constraints of law is as central to economic development and growth as any other aspect of the bubbling activityRobust ConstructibilityMy first purpose in investing in an entire box of Legos was to explore and define concepts of robust constructibility We have succeeded but run into fascinating problems of a general phase transition in problem solvability In turn this very phase transition suggests that in a coconstructing biosphere or econosphere rather specific restrictions arise and are respected by critters and firms creatures and cognoscentiRecall the Lego founder set and the rings rank rank rank each containing the unique Lego objects first constructible from the founder set in a number of steps equal to the rank of that ring Suppose a given Lego house is first constructible in twenty steps hence lies in rank Now it might be the case that there is a single construction pathway from the founder set to the Lego house in twenty steps It might also be the case that there are thousands of construction pathways to the Lego house in twenty steps In the latter case intuitively construction of the Lego house is robust If one way is blocked say because x blocks are temporarily used up then a neighboring pathway will allow the Lego house to be constructed without delay that is in twenty steps using other block sizesA related sense of robustly constructibility concerns how the number of ways to construct the Lego house increases if we take more than the minimum twenty steps say twentyone twentytwo twentythreesteps The number of ways may not increase at all or very slowly or hyperexponentially If the number of ways increases very rapidly it might be worth using twentytwo steps to make the Lego house for it would be virtually impossible to block construction even if several types of building blocks and machines were temporarily brokenBut recall Boeings question They wanted to build a family of related objects Hence let us define still another related sense of robustly constructibleConsider a family of Lego objects a house and a house with a chimney Now consider each of the many ways from the founder set to build the Lego house For each such way to build the Lego house consider how to change construction minimally in order to build the Lego house with the chimney Perhaps the chimney can just be added to the completed Lego house More likely it would be necessary to partially deconstruct that completed Lego house then go on to construct the house with the chimney So there is a last branch point during construction on the way both to the Lego house and the Lego house with the chimneyThe branch point object andor operation that is simultaneously on the way to the house and the house with the chimney is an interesting intermediatecomplexity object or operation because it is polyfunctional It can be used in at least two further waysWhen we build a house we all know that boards and nails are primitive objects and the completed house is the finished object But some intermediate objects say framed windows and framed walls are commonly used Why Because they are intermediate objects that are polyfunctional The technology graph and its branch points are identifying the intermediatecomplexity polyfunctional objects for usBut things are more subtle It might be the case that from the last branch point on a way to make both the house and the house with the chimney there is only a single pathway forward to the house and there is only a single pathway forward to the house with the chimney Not robust Stupid stopping spot Either pathway can readily be blocked Suppose instead we consider an intermediate object three steps prior to the last branch point on the way outward from the founder set Ah perhaps there are thousands of ways to complete the house and to complete the house with the chimney Any single blockage or small set of blockages is readily overcome The house or the house with the chimney can be built without delay if all x blocks are temporarily out of stock Now this is a smart robust intermediatecomplexity polyfunctional objectobjective And it may cost no more to stockpile such smart intermediate objectsSo here is a new view of process design and inventory controlBios colleague Jim Herriot has made a delightful little Java computer model to show technology graphs in action The program shows a chair object a seat object a back object and a leg object In addition there are foam and padding objects two attachment objects a set of screw objects nail objects wood objects a saw object a hammer object and a screwdriver object Each object comes with its own characteristic set of is a has a does a featuresThe program assembles coherent technology graphs and chairassembly pathways as follows An object tries a connection shown by a black line to another object In eect the chair object extends a line to the screw object as it says I need a leanon I need a leanon The screw object responds I do twist holds I do twist holds There is no match After many random tries the chair object extends a black line to the back object I need a leanon I need a leanon says the chair object I do leanons I do leanons cries the back object with cybernetic joy The black line becomes a yellow line as a contract is signed between the chair and back objects In a similar way the back object needs padding and wood objects and either the complementary pair nail and hammer objects or their substitutes screw and screwdriver objects to carry out an attachment operationIn due course the conditions are met to begin construction of partial objects on the way to the entire chair Legs then backs begin to be assembled as screws and nails are used up Eventually a seat is constructed too and the first chair triumphantly followsAll goes well until all the screws are used up The seat having relied on screws and screwdrivers to attach padding goes nuts and looks about frantically asking the screwdriver to work on nails No luck Eventually the seat tries nails and hammers jointly and that complementary pair works More chairs are constructed then nails run out and failures propagate throughout the systemNot a metaphor the technology graph Rather a new tool to understand the general principles of robust constructibility the structure of economic webs a knowledgemanagement tool for a firm a new hunk of basic science Indeed one of the interesting features of technology graphs is that they constitute the proper conceptual framework to consider process and product design simultaneously As far as I can tell we have not had such a conceptual framework beforeNor is the technology graph limited to manufacturing The same general principles apply for example in military or other logistic operations Technology graphs in these other contexts become the sequential set of requirements needed to meet subobjectives that robustly culminate in the achievement of an overall objective Taking hill after diverting gracefully from orders to take hill is logically related to making the house with the chimney after starting to make the house without the chimneyA Phase Transition in Problem SolvabilityPart of the basic science of technology graphs stems from generic phase transitions in problem solvability in many combinatorial optimization or satisficing problems in biology and economics I turn now to discuss these generic phase transitionsI begin with a metaphor You are in the Alps A yellow bromine fog is present Anyone in the fog for more than a microsecond will die There are three regimes the dead the living dead and the survivableThe dead The bromine fog is higher than Mont Blanc Unfortunately everyone diesThe living dead The bromine fog has drifted lower and Mont Blanc the Eiger and the Matterhorn jut into the sunlight Hikers near these three peaks are aliveBut consider that even mountains are not fixed Plate tectonics can deform the mountainous landscape Or in the terms of the last chapter the mountainous fitness landscape of a species or a firm or an armed force can change and persistently deform due to coevolution when other species or firms or adversaries change strategies If the mountainous landscape deforms Mont Blanc the Eiger and the Matterhorn will eventually dip into the bromine fog As this happens perhaps new peaks jut into the sunshine But those peaks will typically be far away from Mont Blanc the Eiger and the MatterhornAlas the hikers near those three initial peaks will die as they are dipped into the lethal fog and are too far from the newly emerged sun drenched peaks to reach them This isolated peaks regime is the living dead regimeBut there is a third regime a phase transition awayThe survivable regime Let the bromine fog drift lower More and more peaks jut into the sunshine At some point some magical point as more peaks emerge into the sunshine quite suddenly a hiker can walk all the way across the Alps in the sunshineThis is a phase transition from the isolated peaks regime A connected webmathematically a percolating webof connected solutions has emerged suddenly as the fog lowers Now consider hikers striding across the Alps knapsacks and hearts full If plate tectonics rather slowly deforms the landscape then whenever hikers are about to be dipped into the lethal bromine fog they can take a sideways step in some direction and remain in the sunshineThe percolating web of solutions regime is persistently survivable In fitness landscape terms if you are evolving on a fitness landscape that is deforming and are in your survivable regime you can continue to exist by stepping somewhere from wherever you happen to find yourselfThis phase transition is generic to hard combinatorial optimization problems A case in point is the wellknown job shop problem The job shop problem posits M machines and O objects The idea is to build the O objects on the machines Each object requires being on each machine in some set order for some fixed period of time Perhaps object must be on machine for minutes then machine for minutes then machine for minutes In turn object must be on machine for minutes then machine for minutes and so onA schedule is an assignment of objects to machines such that all objects are constructed The total length of time it takes to construct the set of objects is called the makespan We may consider for each schedule a definition of neighboring schedules such as swapping the order in which two objects are assigned to a given machine Given the set of possible schedules the neighborhood relation between schedules and the makespan of each schedule there is a makespan fitness landscape over the space of schedules of the job shop problemWe want to minimize makespan But to keep our mountainous landscape metaphor where high peaks are good let us consider optimizing eciency by minimizing makespan So schedules with low makespan correspond to points of high eciency on the jobshop fitness landscape Clearly short makespan makes the problem hard long makespan makes the problem easy So long makespan is like the bromine fog being low while short makespan is like the bromine fog being highDoes the phase transition occur in typical job shop problems as makespan is tuned from long to short Figure shows the results Vince Darley obtained The figure plots makespan short to long on the xaxis and the number of schedules at a given makespan on the yaxisAs you can see for long enough makespan as makespan decreases there are roughly a constant number of schedules at each makespan But at a critically short makespan the number of solutions starts to fall abruptly The corner where the curve starts to turn is the phase transition between the survivable regime for longer makespans and the isolated peaksliving dead regime for shorter makespans I cheat slightly the sharpness of the corner increases as the size of the job shop problem increases in numbers of machines M and objects OThere are a number of direct tests for this phase transition In the survivable regime at longer makespans and lower eciency than the phase transition makespan start with a given schedule at a given makespan Now examine all nearby schedules and test if any is of an equal or better makespan Continue to walk across the space of schedules via neighbors to test if there is a connected web of schedules with makespans at least as good as our initial schedules makespan Either the web percolates across the space of solutions or it does not If the web percolates then the initial schedule was in the survivable regime If only isolated regions of neighboring schedules of the same approximate makespan are found then you are in the isolated peaks regimeA second test looks at the Hausdorf dimensionality of the acceptable solutions at a given makespan or better The Hausdorf dimension is computed by considering an initial schedule at a given makespan then by considering from among all the mutant neighbor schedules the number of them that are of the same or better makespan as the initial schedules makespan then doing the same among all the mutant neighbor schedules The Hausdorf dimension of the acceptable set of schedules at that makespan and point in the job shop space is the ratio of the logarithm of the mutant acceptable schedules to the logarithm of the mutant acceptable schedules In eect the Hausdorf dimension shows how rapidlyin how many dimensions of the jobshop schedule spaceacceptable schedules of a given makespan or better are growing In the survivable regime the Hausdorf dimension on average is greater than In the isolated peaks regime averaged over the job shop space the Hausdorf dimension is less than At the phase transition the dimensionality is The phase transition I have just noted is generic for many or most hard combinatorial optimization problems It is not true for all fitness landscapes For example it would not hold on a conical Fujiyama landscape But the Fuji landscape corresponds to a simple typically linear optimization problem Hard combinatorial optimization problems are multipeaked due to conflicting constraintsA further interesting connection relates the statistics of search on the job shop landscape to learning curves in economics Learning curves well known in arenas from airplane manufacture to diamond cutting to cigar manufacture show that every time the total output of a plant is doubled the cost per unit falls by a rough constant percentage typically to percent If the logarithm of the cost per unit is plotted on the yaxis and the logarithm of the cumulative number of units produced is plotted on the xaxis one gets a typical straightline power law that decreases downward to the rightThe fascinating thing is that this feature probably reflects the statistics of search for fitter variants on rugged correlated fitness landscapes such as the job shop problem Typically in such problems every time a fitter mutant variant is found the fraction of mutant variants that are still fitter falls by a constant fraction while the improvement achieved at each step is typically a constant fraction of the improvement achieved at the last step These properties yield the learning curve My colleagues Jose Lobo Phil Auerswald Karl Shell Bill Macready and I have published a number of papers on the application of the statistics of rugged landscapes and learning curvesBut there is another even more important point We can control the statistical structure of the problem spaces we face such that the problem space is more readily solvable We can and do tune the structure of the problems we solve The capacity to tune landscape structure shows up in the job shop problem In most cases improving the structure of the problem space requires relaxing conflicting constraints to move the problem into the survivable regime at the makespan or eciency you require For a specific case in my statement of the job shop problem I asserted that the O objects must each have access to the M machines in some fixed orderNow simple observation and experience tells you that you can put on your shirt and pants in either order but you had better put on your socks before your shoes In other words some steps in life are permutable others are not Suppose in our job shop problem a fixed fraction P of the steps in the construction of each of the O objects were jointly permutable As P increases and more steps are permutable the conflicting constraints in the total problem are reduced But this in turn means that the entire space of solutions improves that is the entire space shifts toward lower makespan or higher eciencyAnd now the relation to the bromine fog metaphor can be stated clearly As the number of permutable steps increases the conflicting constraints are reduced The entire makespaneciency landscape is lifted higher the peaks are higher and the landscape with fewer conflicting constraints is smoother All in all the result is that the percolating web of solutions where the hikers can walk all across the Alps occurs at a higher eciency and shorter makespanIn terms of Figure the capacity to permute steps in the job shop problem shifts the phase transition point leftward toward shorter makespan Equivalently if one wants to shift the curve in Figure to the left purchase a computable number of machines that are polyfunctional so that the same machine can be used for more than one job That too reduces conflicting constraintsThere is another view of this generic phase transition between solvable and nonsolvable that again highlights the role of having alternative ways of doing things robustly constructible strategies that are not easily blocked In addition the same simple model the Ksat model discussed in the previous chapter begins to account for at least the following anecdotal observation which is apparently typical Colleagues at Unilever noted to us that if they have a plant that manufactures dierent types of a product say toothpaste then the plant does well when the diversity of products grows from three to four to ten to twenty to twentyfive but at twentyseven dierent toothpastes the plant suddenly fails So rather abruptly as product diversity in a given plant increases the system fails Why Presumably it is the same phase transition in problem solvabilityConsider again the Ksat problem taken as a model for community assembly in the last chapter based on the work of Bruce Sawhill and Tim Keitt Figure repeats the Ksat problem and shows again the phase transitionRecall that a Ksat problem consists in a logical statement with V variables in C clauses in normal disjunctive form A v A and A v A and not A v A As we discussed in the previous chapter a normal disjunctive expression with C clauses V variables in total and K variables per clause is satisfiable if there is an assignment of true or false to each of the V variables such that the expression as a whole is trueThe normal disjunctive form makes it clear that as there is an increase in the number of alternative ways K of carrying out a task or making a clause true it is easier to satisfy the combined expression More generally as noted in the last chapter and shown in Figure there is a phase transition in the probability that a random Ksat expression with V variables K per clause and C clauses can be satisfied by some assignment of true or false to the V variables The phase transition occurs in the horizontal axis labeled CV which is the mean number of clauses in which any variable occurs Obviously as CV increases conflicting constraints increase The phase transition from easily solvable to virtually impossible to solve occurs at a point on the CV axis equal to log x raised to the K power or x K Hence as K increases the phase transition shifts outward to greater CV valuesBut Figure gives us an intuitive understanding of Unilevers problem in fact the problem is far more general than Unilevers assembly plants Think of each clause A v A et cetera as a way to make one of the toothpaste products and think of the conjunction A v A and A v A and as the way to make all twentyseven toothpastes Then as the number of clauses hence toothpaste products increases for a given plant with V variables to use in making these dierent products all of a sudden the conjoint problem will have so many conflicting constraints that it will cross the phase transition from solvable to insolvableMoreover for any given number of clauses and V variables if a given assignment of true or false to the V variables satisfies the Ksat problem we can ask if any of the mutant neighbor assignments of true and false to the V variables that change the truth value assigned to one of the V variables also satisfy the Ksat problem Thus we can study the phase transition from a survivable percolating web of solutions regime when VC is lower to an isolated peaks regime as VC increases to virtual impossibility for high VCThus just as in the job shop problem as product diversity increases for a fixed plant a phase transition from survivable to unsurvivable will occur because the conflicting constraints will increase with CV The resulting landscape becomes more rugged the peaks lower the yellow bromine fog rises from the survivable to the living dead to the dead regime covering Mont Blanc and all hikers in the Alps Figure But this takes us back to the technology graph and robust constructibility Recall from above that the Lego house and Lego house with a chimney might be robustly constructible from wisely chosen intermediatecomplexity objects on the pathway to both houses with thousands of ways to get there At no extra cost we might choose to stockpile that intermediatecomplexity polyfunctional object rather than another choiceBut intermediatecomplexity polyfunctional objects are just what allows multiple pathways multiple permutations of construction steps to our two final objects Hence these same smart intermediate objects reduce the conflicting constraints in the fitness landscape over the construction space to make our desired set of objects or our set of toothpastes Lowering the conflicting constraints makes the eciency peaks of the fitness landscapes higher hence allows survivable operations at a higher level of product diversityThus by use of the technology graph to design both products and processes we can choose a family of products and construction pathways with highly redundant intermediate objects That choice makes the problem space easy to solve rather than hard to solve We have thereby tuned the statistical structure of our problem space into a survivable regime Furthermore we can test whether our choice of construction pathways to the house andor house with a chimney is robustly survivable or in the living deadisolated peaks regime We need merely use the technology graph to test for percolating sets of mutant neighboring pathways of construction of the same objects and the average Hausdorf dimension of such pathwaysNo need to operate in the isolated peaks regime Indeed if you face loss of parts and machines you had best locate back from the phase transition deep enough into the survivable regime to survive And if you are a military force fighting against an enemy whose strategy changes persistently deform your payo landscape and whose eorts are to destroy your capacity to fight you had best operate even further back from the phase transition in the survivable regime Indeed the normal disjunctive form in Figure is a rough image of the complexity of a campaign you can fightthe number of clauses that must be jointly satisfied to meet your objectives where each clause is a subobjective and there are K alternative ways to meet that objective using V weapon systemsJust as warfare and the economy as a whole have much in common warfare and the biosphere have much in common If you are a species coevolving with other species you had best operate back from the phase transition well into the survivable regimeThere is a message If you must make a living for Gods sake make your problem space survivableThis brings us back to a point made in early chapters Recall the nofreelunch theorem proved by Bill Macready and David Wolpert Given a family of all possible fitness landscapes on average no search algorithm outperforms any other search algorithm Hill climbing is on average no better than random search in finding high peaks when averaged over all possible fitness landscapesThe nofreelunch theorem led me to wonder about the following We organisms use mutation recombination and selection in evolution and we pay twofold fitness for sex and recombination to boot But recombination is only a useful search procedure on smooth enough fitness landscapes where the high peaks snuggle rather near one anotherIn turn this led me to wonder where such nice fitness landscapes arise in evolution for not all fitness landscapes are so blessedly smooth Some are random Some are anticorrelatedIn turn this led me to think about and discuss natural games or ways of making a living Since ways of making a living evolve with the organisms making those livings we got to the winning games are the games the winners play Which led me to suggest that those ways of making a living that are well searched out and exploited by the search mechanisms organisms happen to usemutation recombination and selectionwill be ways of making a living that are well populated by organisms and similar species Ways of making a living that cannot be well searched out by organisms and their mutation recombination search procedures will not be well populatedSo we came to the reasonable conclusion that a biosphere of autonomous agents is a selfconsistently selfconstructing whole in which agents ways of making a living and ways of searching for how to make a living all work together to coconstruct the biosphere Happily we are picking the problems we can manage to solve Of course if we could not solve our chosen ways to make livings we would be deadAnd there is I think a molecular clue that the biosphere is persistently coconstructing itself in the survivable regime for a propagating set of lineages We have just characterized the survivable percolating web regime where the fitness landscape of each creature deforms due to the adaptive moves of other creatures but there are always neighboring ways of surviving Genetically those neighboring ways are one or a few mutations or recombinations away from where the species population is right now If the biosphere has coconstructed itself such that most species are in a survivable regime then as coevolution occurs most species will persist but may well transform for example to daughter species One would guess that this mildly turbulent process is rather continuous perhaps with some selforganized critical bursts on a power law scaleThe molecular clock hypothesis seems to fit these facts If one compares hemoglobins from humans chimps horses whales and so on in general the longer ago we diverged from one another in the evolutionary record the more amino acid mutations distinguish the hemoglobins of the two species involved Our hemoglobin is very similar to chimp hemoglobin and quite dierent from the whale So good is this correlation that within given protein families it is argued that mutations accumulate with timelike clockwork hence the molecular clock hypothesis in which a number of amino acid dierences can be taken as a surrogate for time from the most common ancestor Dierent protein family clocks seem to run at dierent ratesThere is evidence that the clock does not run quite smoothly John Gillespie a population biologist now at the University of California at Davis showed some years ago that amino acid substitutions seemed to come in short bursts that accumulate over long periods of time to a rough molecular clock that stutters Gillespie argued that fitness landscapes were episodically shifting and the bursts of amino acid substitutions were adaptive runs toward nearby newly formed peaks I agree and suggest that the near accuracy of the molecular clock data over hundreds of millions of years and virtually all species strongly suggests that the biosphere has coconstructed itself such that species even as they speciate and go extinct are as lineages in the persistently survivable regimeWe as organisms have in fact constructed our ways of making a living such that those problem spaces are typically but not always solvable as coevolution proceeds And on average the same thing holds for the econosphere As old ways of making a living go extinct new ones persistently enter We too it appears have coconstructed our econosphere such that our ways of making a living and discovering new ways of making a living are manageable probably in a selforganized critical manner with small and large speciation and extinction eventsAnd there is a corollary If you are lucky enough to be in the survivable regime you can survive by being adaptable What is required to be adaptable as an organism or organization We discussed this in the last chapter A good guess is that an organism or organization needs to be poised in an ordered regime near the edge of chaos where a power law distribution of small and large avalanches of change propagates through the system such that it optimizes the persistent balance between exploration and exploitation on evershifting coevolving fitness landscapesLaws for any biosphere extend presumably to laws for any economy Nor should that be surprising The economy is based on
